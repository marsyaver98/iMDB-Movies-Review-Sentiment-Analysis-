Title,Review,Rating Score
Never played the games so I can't compare,I never played the Fallout games or knew anything about them so I had no idea what to expect but I have to say that I've really enjoyed it so far. This show hooked me from the first episode and held my attention to the last. I binged the entire season in two days and was still hoping for more episodes when I was done. It seems like some of the people who actually played the games didn't like it as much but as long as try not to compare it to the game and just enjoy it for what it is...and that's an entertaining fantasy/sci-fi series. The series should be judged on its own and not compared to the game. The world building and cast are the best things about the show and I can't wait for more. I promise you'll have a blast watching this and will want to binge it as fast as you can.,9
I am in love with this show,"THIS is how you make a video game to movie/tv show series. THIS is how you pander to gamers while appealing to new audiences. THIS is excellent 21st century entertainment.I won't waste time explaining the premise, I'm sure you've gotten the gist by now from other reviews. Just know that it seems like gamer who are fans of the game series (such as myself) are quite happy with it, and that people unfamiliar with the game series (like my wife) are also engrossed with this show.SO MANY REFERENCES to the game makes it fun to watch as a long-time gamer fan. Everything, from junk decor like magazine racks and plastic jack-o-lantern buckets, to power armor, enemies, factions, food, chems, characters, and weapons, is familiar.Sure, it may be a bit overproduced, have some cheesy and weak CGI effects, and contain a lot of the ""modern formula"" in its script and story. Aside from that, it's got everything anyone would want for a riveting sci-fi, action, drama, comedy, horror adventure. Seriously, this show, like the game series, covers all the bases.And oh my goodness, mini fan-gush moment here, but, I was so excited to hear Matt Berry's voice, I was totally not expecting it, and it was an awesome cameo as one of the easily recognizable robots in the universe of Fallout. And let's just say his is not the only shocking and awesome cameo in the series. Fans of shows like Archer might be pleasantly surprised in Episode 6.What's also so cool, is that like the stories you run into in the game, there are a lot of really interesting plots with crazy twists. The vaults may seem more like a paradise than on the surface, but when you dig deep, sometimes, the vaults are scarier than reality under the sun...Fallout has been around for two and half decades, and it's taken them this long to finally come out with a tv/movie adaptation? You know what? Since they nailed it, I'd say it was worth the wait.",9
Better Than Expected,"Fallout is even better than I expected. It's up there as one of the best video game adaptations ever. Fallout takes pace a couple hundred years after a nuclear apocalypse and people have to live in underground bunkers to protect themselves. There is a world going on above full of radiation that's created mutants and a lawless society full of evil people and violence. All the people living in these underground communities are forced to come up and live. Ella Purcell stars as Lucy, one of the people who's never been above ground before and wasn't prepared for the lawless society it has become. One of the most underrated actors ever in Walton Goggins steals the show once again as a mutant bandit. This series is just flat out awesome.",9
Probably the best gaming adaptation ever,"Fallout franchise had a few shifts in the lore and perception, resulting in even the fans arguing about ""what Fallout should be"".While the series are not as gritty-depressive as Fallout 1-2, and followed a bit closer to the Bethesda's vision, the level of actual dedication to the franchise will make it liked by everyone!The props are amazing, the lore is very fitting, the characters are matching the universe. In-game brands and characters are exactly in place. It is no Master Chief from AliExpress, but a great adaptation which does not retell the story of any of the games directly.The storytelling will both properly introduce the universe to those who had never heard about it and please the fans. It is rare. But what is even more outstanding - even if Fallout games wouldn't exist, the show is highly entertaining.Nowadays we see more and more game-sourced shows, and it is great Fallout joins Cyberpunk, Arcane and The Last of Us in the list.",10
we want more Fallout,"I was afraid this show will be weak or average, but it's simply awesome.Everything is very detailed, every item is like from Fallout, as if someone who knows the game created a movie - it's truly shocking that this is possible in 2024.The humor, the story, the mood, the music - everything is there!!!I was afraid that Lucy will be ""strong woman"" like in other modern shows but she is very cool and likeable. Of course Cooper is fantastic and Maximus is also great.Dear Amazon, dear Jeff Bezos - please cancel Rings of Power immediately and put all your money into the next seasons of Fallout!",10
Does Not Disappoint,"I am a massive fan of the game. And have gone through New Vegas more times than I should admit. But, the embodiment and spirit is alive and well through the eyes of Lucy McLean (Ella Purnell) a vault dweller who hasn't had to experience real adversity in life.If you've seen ""Blast From The Past"" (1999) a lot of this will be familiar. Though not as dark, it took the simple sweet naive character of Brendan Fraser and put him in real world Los Angeles. Same here. Except MUCH darker.The humor is dark as well. What director Jonathan Nolan did so well is to incorporate a sense of futility in the lives, similar to game play.The lighting and camera work are spot on to the game. You can tell they REALLY studied it. A lot of places, if you've played the game, will seem very familiar. But also, it's just different enough where you don't roll your eyes thinking it's all fan service. He integrates small things like Cram and Nuka Cola with such ease, it's almost like the meme where Leo DiCaprio keeps pointing at the screen to get your attention.The eye popping primary colors of the 50's/60's era is in full swing. If you can't tell the difference between film and digital, this puts your eyes to ease. Clearly this was a film shot movie. Glossy in texture, they lean into the fringe edges.Not that any viewer would intellectually care, but you really feel the Wasteland.Again, if you played the game, you know how many worlds they can explore here.'
Actress Ella Purnell plays the wide-eyed vault child perfectly. She's sweet and wholesome in a newly brutal world. Similar to Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leona Huxley in ""Demolition Man"" Though not necessarily excited for a bygone era.The characters she encounters only beefs up the idea of how over her head she's gotten herself into.The setup does feel a little rush. It begins with just absolute brutality. Yes, this is introduced. But, it really plays like the game. Where violence is dismissed quickly. If you haven't played, it's going to be a little off-putting. But it does make sense. It took me off guard for a moment. The idea is to get that open world feel and this series does it perfectly.This is one of the video game series I am absolutely excited to see continue. There is SO much to mine and I'm ready for it.Well done all!",9
Fan-blanking-tastic.,"I never write reviews but this was the best dang show (series) I've watched since Band of Brothers. You don't need to know anything about the game, like me, to thoroughly enjoy it either. The characters are interesting and none of them are unlikeable. Even the bad guys are likeable in a bad way. Acting is superb and the settings/SFX are great. The whole look of the show is a Jetsons retro-futuristic look.The actress who plays Lucy plays the ""strong, independent woman"" like it should be played.Maximus, aka, Knight Titus, perhaps the most relatable to me, at least if I found myself in a similar scenario as him but the most enjoyable to watch was Walter Googins as the cowboy Ghoul. His character arc probably isn't as complex as the other two main characters, at least in the first season, but he is quite satisfying how he takes cares of business. 10 out of 10.",10
Honest Review From A Game Fan,"I was hoping this would be good. Last thing you wanna do is get the Fallout fan base angry, which after reading reviews on here and Facebook, you would think it was teally bad. Well, it's not. They have an opportunity here. Not following a specific game and starting elsewhere was a great move. The feel and the story is so far, true to the lore. The vault, the wasteland, the weapons, suits, all of it good. Don't listen to the fanboy ""experts"". Even if this wasn't Fallout based, it's still a good show. Looking forward to what's to come and so far it's good. I highly recommend it, Fallout fan or not!!!",9
One of the best Adaptation I've seen years,As someone who grew up in the era where the video game was popular all I can say is wow this is one of the best adaptations i've seen in a long time because it takes what was successful about the beloved video game and matches it with an original Story and I definitely think all the praise about this show is well deserved plus the cast is really good too and if you are a fan of either the game or the show this is for you and I definitely can't wait for season two I also have a feeling that season two will be bigger better also expands the universe from the video game and I am definitely a fan of dystopian futures.,7
Didnt expect much - got more than i could´ve hoped for.,"Knowing the history of Videogame adaptations, i really expected the worst from this. Adding that i could be quite the harsh critic, loving the games as i do.But honestly, this exceeded my expectations. From funny, gory to exciting and epic, this had it all. You feel like the perfect mixture of Fallout-experts and newcomers came to sit at the table and make a good adaptation that everyone can enjoy. Even the game got a good reaclaimed boost from this, which confirms the series succes.Every character got its up and downs, feeling quite three-dimensional. There is no real ""hero"" ( even though the Lucy-character embarks on the traditionel heroes journey), knowing that the dark, crazy and twisted world of the Fallout Apocalpye doesnt allow to just be ""the nice guy"".Nevertheless, i have to say that Walton Goggins and his depiction of the Ghoul carried the show for me at many points. I couldnt get enough of his character and loved every scene he was in. I cant wait to see the next season.",8
"Good Fallout adaptation, but mediocre writing.","Being a fan of the FPS games I was optimistic about the show when I read the game creator was involved. It doesn't disappoint in that regard. It captures the spirit of Fallout quite well, in every aspect. The visuals, the props, the music, the humor, and specially the violence. It really feels like you're watching cutscenes of a new Fallout game. Where it disappoints is on the actual story. The characters are interesting, but the general plot and the arc of each one are completely predictable. What kept my interest were the creative ""show, don't tell"" moments and the funny surprises that happened here and there, rather than the resolution of the plot which I could predict from a mile away. It's not great, but it's a good show and I'm looking forward to season 2.",7
Skewed by gamers,"The series is reviewing well because of nostalgia from gamers that really love the game, as it's tough to separate the two.The show is shallow and hollow. Walton Goggins is the best part of the show. The writing is horrible; vault dwellers are ultra naive and assume an awkward sense of superiority. Other than that, the show is super contrived; the main character gets her finger cut off but replaced with a dead finger that works as if nothing ever happened. The main Brotherhood lacky somehow never gets caught doing everything wrong, but even when he has the chance to do something amazing he blows it.Aside from the first two episodes it's a pretty boring show, people just have really low expectations.",4
Lucy is GREAT,"So, I'm only peripherally familiar with Fallout as my husband and son played the game, so I had no expectations going into the watching of this series. I was so pleasantly surprised to find the character Lucy is no Mary Sue and in my opinion is the best written female character in an action series I've seen in quite a while. The series is easy to follow even for the uninitiated (such as myself), it looks great, the casting is perfect, it has an intriguing mystery at its core, and the pilot grabbed my attention upon hitting the ""play"" button. There seems to be much debate about the timeline, etc. From dedicated fans but I recommend it regardless (I do not believe in toxic fandom so I respect dissenting opinions in this regard). We as an audience have been fed subpar content for far too long and I believe this series is worthy of a watch. Amazon actually and surprisingly got it right with this series and praise is due for that. Check it out.",9
What a f#cking ride!,"Extraordinary detail, extraordinary story, extraordinary conclusion. One of the finest fantasy/post apocalyptic content I have seen so far.The series just takes off and theres no stopping, back to back explosions at your face and leaves your jaw dropped on the floor. The design, cgi and attention to details is just groundbreaking. Content these days is just so mediocre that you dont even want to chance 3 hours of your life into watching something like Aquaman 2 or wonder woman or the recent movies that make you question whats up with CGI hollywood? Tired already? But then this comes out and Kingdom of planet of apes comes out restoring your belief in the capabilities of true hollywood detail.",10
Nails the vibe,"I've watched all eight episodes of Fallout and I have been pleasantly surprised. This show does a really good job of nailing the feel of the games, with it's mix of gore and wacky humour.All three protaganists are interesting to watch but I particularly liked The Ghoul, who had a strong backstory, and the Vault Dweller, who's naivety made for quite a few laughs.The locations in the show were styled on the game and were true to the game. Although, they were all smaller locations. There were no wanderings in large, destroyed cities. I guess that would have meant a bigger CGi budget, so it's understandable.Also, it would have been nice if there was more danger in the wasteland created by the multitude of creatures from the game. This felt a bit neglected in the show. Again, I suspect this would have added to the budget. Perhaps these small quibbles could be rectified in Season 2. Surely there will be a Season 2 as this first season is surely going to be a success.I absolutely loved the way the plot threads came together in the last episode. It was really satisfying and leaves room for the story to continue.One last point. I've played and been a fan of all the games over the past few decades and find the 1-star reviews from fans of the game to be very strange. What are your expectations? You have to give the writers the chance to tell a story about characters in the Fallout World and they've done that very well. The set designers, costume artists, etc have nailed the style too, so how can this be a 1-star show? Insanity!",9
Review from a Fallout newbie...,"Fallout is a sure fire way to introduce non-fans to the iconic franchise. As for me, I had casual knowledge of the video games from friends and family, but I've never played them myself (I've gravitated to stuff like Final Fantasy, Mass Effect and Legend of Zelda when it comes to role-playing action-adventure games). Now I think I just might play them, because the show does a good job of establishing the world for fans and non-fans alike. THIS is video game television done right just like The Last of Us (of which I am a fan).The show has your 'typical' post-apocalyptic tropes of desperate survivors killing each other for resources like food and water, but things are distinctly more nuclear here, as the world's suffered several Atomic Holocausts since the late-21st Century in Fallout's timeline. It's a dark setting filled with surprisingly goofy black humor and bloody gunslinging action, and a retro-futuristic future that's ACTUALLY all about the future itself. Also the characters range from doe-eyed people naive of the wider world, to weary cowboys untrusting of anyone or anything unless they themselves are the ones in control of their own life. Also, the Brotherhood is like if a syndicate of steampunk-like Iron Man suits brought medieval traditions into a 'post-societal world' of knights and squires doing the bidding of their lords.Update relating to the series: saying nothing of the spoilers here, Fallout Season Two is official! Will it continue the stories told here strictly, or will there be even more characters set to appear in this series adapting one of gaming's most iconic franchises? Whatever happens, I'm sure it'll continue what made Season One a strong magnet for television audiences in the first place. Amazon may be letting the irony of the 'Vault Tec' go under their nose or over their head, but I don't know if anyone else is as oblivious to it as them. It's genuinely funny when a hit show has something to say about corporate America, when the satire is backed by one of today's ultimate perps of corporate culture being a terrifyingly unstable double-edged sword. It's funnily scary that way.Fallout continues Amazon's tradition of trying to oust its competition in Netflix and HBO, by trying to use the methods of both brands: releasing the show day one and using marquee actors (like Kyle MacLachlan), sex and violence to forward the story, and Ramin Djawadi doing the theme music (that's a must for HBO at this stage). With the show continuing, it's gonna be interesting to see how the Fallout show will go beyond the world of the games.Overall, it's a good show. It's very watchable, has a great post-apocalyptic vibe to it, and the story keeps getting more interesting the further you keep watching and seeing the world kind of open up as the episodes play along.Fallout gets 9/10 IMDb points. 4.5/5 stars.",9
"Great show, just a little too much going on","This show does an absolutely great job respecting the lore and giving the show the care it deserves. The writers were obviously educated on the franchise and did a lot of things right.Characters were all around great. When I saw the trailers and saw Lucy trying to deliberate with the ghoul I was thinking it would be really childish and lacking of any tension but it shows her naivety and innocence in the show and shows how she's so out of her element, it's great.The only hiccup is there's a little too much going on, there's like 4 different stories that actually do converge quite nicely at the end but it's a little disorienting throughout the entirety of the show. It's definitely better to have too much than too little but I could've done with just a little less in my opinion.Regardless, characters were great, knowledge of the lore was great, great plot, great set up for season 2, funny references to the games throughout the show, just a really good job all around. Even if you're not aware of the games or their story, this works as a stand alone show just fine. This is everything that shows should use as a template when making content that is from existing media. Very well done.",9
Eh,"I really thought after watching this show I was going to come back to IMDB and see a score around 6.7 or 6.8. It looks like that is not the case and by leaving a 7 star review I am going to be in the minority.Here's why I gave it that score; it has appeal to the masses but does little to actually stand out as a piece of cinema. It does capture the many fun details I wanted to see as someone who grew up playing Fallout games, but it fails to break away from the recycled Hollywood template of making a modern day television show. The acting is subpar. Most of it is bad.Walton Goggins and Moises Arias are fantastic. Ella Purnell can carry her weight but didn't particularly stand out. The guy who plays Maximus has a lot of work to do as an actor. Dogmeat did a great job.Overall, this movie felt like another ""Safeway brand"" version of a show that could have been incredibly unique and badass. Some of the scenes were so cringe and hard to watch (ie: the BHOS chanting Maximus name at the end of the show). Like I said, if you like Taylor Swift then you probably liked this show and thought it was badass. If you don't like Taylor Swift and are a cinema connoisseur, then this was enjoyable but at times hard to watch because of the extreme corniness.It was great to finally watch a respectable adaptation of a game that I spent hundreds of hours playing in my youth and still cherish today.A for the adaptation, but a C for the execution.",7
"Starts as fiction, turns into a cautionary tale","I was really surprised on how this show turned out to be, I consider myself a casual gamer and I had given a try to the Fallout games before but I got to be honest - I didn't become a fan... After some hours, no matter how good the story was the overall gameplay didn't do it for me. Nonetheless I am really glad that the fans also enjoyed the adaption because I have a feeling that this is a rare occasion where the TV format actually works better for the story than the original.I have been saying this often, one of the most hard things to do in the entertainment industry is to successfully adapt a video game, into a movie or a TV show. We've seen great developments in this realm recently and Fallout is just one of those recent successes. Everything seems to work perfectly, the portray of the characters, all around, the amazing environment and overall atmosphere created with a mix of astonishing practical effects, real locations and of course some CGI, the narrative and story telling that feeds us the pieces of the puzzle slowly as the series progresses, leaving room for some future surprises in the seasons to come.I was really glad when I saw Jonathan Nolan was involved, one of my favorite writers, highly experienced in the Sci-Fi genre, everything was aligned to make this a great project.The way the moral grey areas are explored in this brutal and harsh environment are really well played out and of course I can't go without mentioning how incredibly well the political side was introduced within the context of the story. For me it actually does serve as a cautionary tale, it leaves room for some reflection, I was shocked that this fictional, made up apocalyptical and sadistic world brought some elements that are real today and others that while not a reality somehow they felt like a daunting possibility... We really need to prioritize dialogue these days otherwise self-extinction is no longer a distant possibility but more of an inevitability.It's an amazing show, great dialogues, great cinematography, well written, even the graphical violence seems to serve its purpose - although some of the gore scenes felt a bit unnecessary - mixed up with some dark humor that actually does work quite well, it's a must. I am really looking forward to see how everything wraps up.",9
"Not great, not terrible","I don't think the series is bad, but I have the same problem with it as I did with ""Fallout 4"" - yes, it's still Fallout, but somehow it's not my Fallout anymore. Too colorful, too squeaky, too childish. The series unfortunately doesn't make me think about going back to New Vegas.Maybe my problem is that I didn't like Fallout 4 and have been very critical of the whole franchise ever since, and maybe I'm too old. ""Fallout 1"", ""Fallout 2"", ""Fallout Tactics: Broterhood of Steel"", ""Fallout 3"" and ""Fallout: New Vegas"" are games that I remember fondly, but Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 were disasters in my eyes.This series isn't a disaster, but it's rather mediocre for me.",7
Either I'm old and bored or If Sucks,"I'm old now. This show made me realize I'm just flat out old. I don't get what it is people like. I didn't laugh, I didn't like the cgi gore, I didn't like the characters, I hated them actually, , but I guess the sets and costumes were cool, in a weird seaquest way. But I just felt so lost on everything else. For me it's a mismatch between humor and I guess action? Or horror? I don't know what the show is going for. After the first fight scene with The Ghoul i actually turned it off because it was so so slow. Even in the middle of the fight scene they'd stop and have characters explain things. What's up with that? Why not just have a damn action scene. I eventually started back up to finish it out. But I just can't stand these characters. Is it supposed to be funny? I am pretty sure it is, but what is funny I'm not sure. Vault girl's naivety? Is that the joke? Is that what I'm laughing at? Her being a moron? Or is it the horror and death? Is that the joke? Or is it the actual jokes which were lame? I blame myself. I think I'm just old and this is not meant for me. It's boring but flashy. Slow but frenetic. The action is awkward and has too many jokes or attempts at jokes interstiched into it with weird explanations about the plot stuck in. Actually I'm fine. This show just is just lame. The more I think on it the more I realize it's the show, not me. Save your time and find something coherent or actually funny. If your a huge nerd that plays online games, I bet you'll love her and I bet you'll love all the ""jokes"".The 4 stars is mainly for the costumes and some of the sets. The rest is worse than mediocre.",3
Psssst... It's OK to like the show even if it isn't perfect!,"Like many other reviewers here, I am a diehard fan of the Fallout games. My introduction to the game series began 25 years ago when I picked up a copy of Fallout 2 and I've been hooked ever since. Never, in all that time, had I ever wished for a spinoff TV series to be made about it. Who asked for it? Not me! But nevertheless, here it is. It exists whether we like it or not and no matter how many negative reviews people submit based on pride, protest, or principle it will not change that fact. Look, no one is forcing anyone who strongly objects to this series to watch it (not yet anyway). But if its mere existence truly offends you, just don't watch it! What is there to gain by coming here to thumbs down positive reviews because you are so aggrieved? Anyone and everyone is free to ignore the show, just like I'm choosing to ignore the sense of entitlement these petty review-bombers have by giving this new series the glowing review it rightfully deserves based on the merits.With that business out of the way, my review here is for anyone with a sincere interest in this series in deciding whether they should give it a chance. And to that I say yes, absolutely you should whether you are a fan of the games or not. As I previously mentioned, I never asked for this show and was prepared to hate it. But I kept an open mind as I watched and did my best to be fair in my overall judgement. And the truth is, the show is actually pretty fantastic. I was not prepared for it to be as good as it is. This show definitely caters to fans of the franchise with its high attention to detail and faithfulness to source material. I sympathize with those who would have preferred that Hollywood not make the series in the first place, but at the same time, now having watched it, the hate towards it is pretty unjustified if the only crime is that it exists.To the angry Fallout fans I ask you this: Imagine a TV series is being made about this game that you and I both love. Imagine that it's completely out of your control, and production is actually happening. If a Fallout series HAS to exist, what exactly would you want it to look like? Would it not be similar to exactly what Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have created? I mean, visually it's pretty spot on. They've built an immersive world that feels very authentic. It feels like Fallout, it looks like Fallout, and it sounds like Fallout. Okay, maybe you would have preferred the show was modeled after the Interplay games and not Bethesda's Fallout 4, or maybe you would have preferred the show runners double and triple check the accuracy of the lore because you find any cannon inconsistency unforgiveable.So let's address the elephant in the room: Yes, there are some glaring lore issues. But it doesn't bother me. Why? Because a TV series is a different medium for storytelling than a video game. For the sake of argument, let's assume this new series runs for 8 seasons with 8 one-hour episodes each. That's a total of 64 hours screen time. That's just a fraction of what most people put into playing a single game. I've put hundreds of hours into Fallout 4 alone. When playing a game, you have the luxury of time to explore it and study it as much as you like. That's the beauty of Fallout games. But television doesn't work that way. It's not interactive. The entertainment comes from literally just sitting in front of a screen and watching/listening to a story. Viewers are going to tune out fast if it becomes overly pedantic and boring. Sometimes it is necessary to truncate and/or modify original source material so that it translates better on screen and can hold the viewers' attention.For me personally, as a longtime fan, what mattered most was that the series captured the spirit, message, and immersive atmosphere of the games. No matter what, it needed to look and feel like Fallout, and Nolan and Joy nailed it. I don't know what more they could have done to make the series better than it is, and I'm honestly relieved that the creative liberties taken were not so egregious as to disrespect the entire franchise and its fanbase. On the contrary, they've done an excellent job here. They could have reimagined Fallout into some truly terrible fan fiction, but they didn't. It feels like a true extension of the Fallout universe and that's all I had hoped for. Jonathan Nolan made this series because he is also a fan and avid player of Fallout games. If anyone could pull it off, it was him.",9
I survived a severe brain injury at the age of 21!,"Unfortunately that injury has left me with chronic head pain everyday. I can't play video games. I never heard of this until it became a show. I've binged watched it over and over. It really is that much fun. Don't come looking for serious sci-fi. Although it does pull at your heart strings from time to time. It is a very well made show. Definitely love and care went into bringing this to life. Ella Purnell as Lucy MacLean, Walter Goggins as Cooper Howard/The Ghoul and Aaron Moten as Maximus are the stand outs of the series. I'm really looking forward to a second season. There's so many more questions that need to be answered.",10
Very awesome series,From the start of to the finish I could not stop watching this series. Sinse I have hundreds of hours playing fallout 4 with the expansions I can honestly say this series is very similar and was awesome seeing a game to series that was so good. I feel this series have plenty of potential as the game has plenty of content they can work with and I hope to see a lot more seasons to come. They have only grazed of how much potential there is in the fallout world. The acting was good I loved the jokes and the gore got me looking away in the one scene and that does not often happen to me in a show...,10
Crawl out into the Fallout.,"Fallout (2024-) Season 1 ReviewJonathan Nolan and Todd Howard truly brought Fallout to life. Prior to any trailers, I saw set photos of the costumes, props, and sets. It looked like they were pulled straight out of the game. And with Bethesda's close relationship with Nolan, I didn't doubt it would be faithful to the visuals, at least. But what I didn't expect was how well written it was going to be.Starting with our main character, Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), she's a vault dweller from Vault 33. Who is on a mission to rescue her father from the wasteland warlord Moldaver (Sarita Choudhury). Very much akin to the main questline of Bethesda's first Fallout game Fallout 3. Although there are far more dark secrets revealed about the history of Vault-Tec, which I won't spoil.Maximus (Aaron Moten) is our second point of view character. He serves to give us insight into The Brotherhood of Steel. They are insular knights in power armor who search for pre-war artifact. Maximus is at the bottom of this totem pole. Only becoming a squire when his friend gets injured. Then he let's his knight die because he was blaming him for his injuries. Maximus then takes Knight Titus's power armor and steals his identity. Overall, he probably had the most character development, gaining courage and compassion from having to endure the wasteland.Finally, there is my favorite character, The Ghoul (Walton Goggins). The Ghoul has been a wandering bounty hunter for over 200 hundred years. Placing his birth date before even the bombs fell. Originally, he was movie star Cooper Howard. A former soldier who spends his days galavanting in movies as a cowboy, while his wife Barb (Frances Turner) is a head scientist for the development of vaults. However, it's murky as to what happened to his family after the bombs fell. Now, he's an actual cowboy being a relic of a previous age on a desperate search to find his family.",10
"Great Scene, messed up Storyline.","Can somebody explain: what's the scene about the professor in the dog training facility, meticulously hiding the dog but suddenly ended up making a cold fusion?Lucy discovering the Cult that Worships Moldova and showing a video of people being eaten by Gulper, yet continues to hide the research of it?Showing lots of messed up plots, like showing vaulters being mutated without a reason or explanation of why are they mutated. Ghoul baiting the Gulper just to try to stab it with a spear and loses its serum and just leaving it without the dog.Other than that, the Costume and the Scene in relation to the game is perfect. Love the realistic Vault, the weapons and costumes.Just wish the storyline direction is better.",8
"I expected greatness, I got mediocrity","For those that have never played the game, the basic premise is that the protagonist starts in an underground fallout shelter called a vault, and through various circumstances is forced to the surface in a struggle to survive.This show gets that part right, but it's via a poorly written story that has no coherent thought process behind it. Sure, there's a general plot that is followed in each episode. Unfortunately, the writers don't seem to want to actually tell a good story, they just want to set up individual scenes that are loosely tied together... and don't even get me started on the plethora of plot holes and inconsistencies.On a positive note, the show does a good enough job of capturing the look and feel of the Fallout world. However, it does not seem to populate that world with all of the enemies and monsters that you would find in the game. It gives you a few ghouls and radroaches here and there, but the actual Fallout world is teeming with these, as well as an abundance of other nasties to be dealt with.Overall, I was very disappointed with this because, as the title says, I expected greatness and I got mediocrity.",6
"Funny, Dark, and Violent","I'm on episode 4 currently. I am very impressed with the show. I normally would not write a review, but after reading the typical ""DEI"" 2 star reviews by people who it is obvious have not even watched the show, I felt obliged to tell people that it is in fact a good show. It does not preach any sort of political message. The cast is excellent. It is a blend of fallout, western, and some gory flick that I can't quite name. I'm serious about the gore, you are going to see some heads explode. It is the best TV adaptation of a video game to date and I highly recommend that everyone give it a chance. You will enjoy it.",10
"Never played the games, meh.","The first episode really did what was necessary to get people hooked. Episode two was slow moving, and I nearly turned it off after the first twenty minutes. It wasn't until the show down in Filly that I decided it was worth finishing. Each episode after felt like the pace was all over the place: lots of slow bits, a few exciting parts, pretty meh. As I've never played the games, I went in blind, trying to figure out what was going on.Overall, I think the show was done well, however I have issues with how open-ended it was. I know that cliff-hangers are meant to keep people intrigued, but as a writer myself I just think there was far too much unanswered. The whole season could have been longer, and the cliff-hangers could have been much tidier.Aside from the annoying characters like Thadeous, who has the most punch-able face I've ever seen (shout out to the actor for playing the role well!), or the random Vault 4 filled with ""mutated(?)"" People, I'm not sure if playing the games would even answer any of my questions, as the show went in its own direction.I will be watching season 2 in hopes that things get explained, because nothing is more annoying than a storyline that introduces a bunch of things just to pretend they never happened (here's looking at you, GOT).The acting itself was really good, I think everyone did a great job portraying the characters for what they were. You know the acting is good when you have strong emotional feelings about the characters.Overall I get why some people are hyping it up, and I get why some people are tearing it apart. I'm pretty in the middle right now, but visually the show was pleasing, and I really love the actors in it for how great they did, so I went with a 7 overall. Hoping season 2 knocks our socks off and goes for the 10/10.",7
which reviewers aren't high right now?,"The best thing about the show is how they incorporated some of the best music of all time, though that was all art captured from a bygone era. This show's writing is very mediocre and might best be viewed with the dialogue turned off entirely. In doing so, you would experience the pretty great looking set designs and art. You could then imagine the rest, and create your own interpretations of what the characters might be talking about, which could also be far more enjoyable. Let me set it up for you: like they always say, look at the birdie. Then imagine that governments aren't actually to blame for disasters. Stick people in human farm capsules for a couple hundred years and see which psychoses explode. With the exception of the cowboy, the characters are undeveloped. Most of the vault dwellers are not only naive, but also stupid. There are a few fun cameos which offset the scene where you imagine michael rappaport weaseled his way into a role where he plays the complete opposite of how his character would have behaved. The main character's stilted and missed every attempt at development throughout her story and is basically a version of zooey deschanel in that who's jess show or whatever it was called, from start to finish mugging for cuteness cred. Enjoy how she has no serious emotional reaction when she has to do something that should be mortifying (you'll know it when you see it).Yeah, the violence is gratuitous as is the nature of the game, and much of it does nothing whatsoever to advance the plot of a TV SHOW. There are no deathclaws. The euphemisms are childish. People magically bump into each other. Vault cousins diddle each other. Try not to cringe when any character makes any reference to sex.On a positive note, there's some good social commentary- my favorite scene is when a community determines the best way to deal with psychopathic killers is to try to rehabilitate them.You can tell that the writers tried hard to make things seem funny, but the funniest moment is a brief scene featuring fred armisen. Otherwise, just admire the scenery.",5
Really enjoyed this as a fan of the games,"They really matched the tone and aesthetic of the game's world design, especially liked the backstory of the ghoul and introduction of the NCR, the vault dwellers, the BoS. The world of game translated to the screen better than I could have imagined going in.Overall pacing of each episode was nearly perfect, great balance between A and B plot lines and felt how they brought in backstories, primarily the ghoul really added depth to the character in a believable way.As for the leads, I had no idea whom any of them were before this show, but they all nailed their roles. Ella Purnell pulls of the naïveté of the vault dweller, Aaron Moten gave humility to a BoS knight, and Walton Goggins as the ghoul steals every scene he's in.The guest stars were quite good as well, as it was nice to see some familiar faces make cameos.The only thing that gives me some hesitancy, is that with Nolan/Joy as executive producers, it could turn into another Westworld, a show that I absolutely loved at the close of its first season, and gave up after its second. I'm leaning towards that not being the case, as Fallout does have some deep lore and more fan service left to cover.",9

True to the games + Walton Goggins,"Always skeptical about projects like this however Fallout exceeded every expectation.I'm a huge fallout fan. Played all the single player modern era games (3, NV + 4). And from the very first episode, it felt like I was watching Fallout 5. The props, staging, characters, the dialogue, even the way the characters converse, I was seeing dialogue trees in my head, plus the camera angles looked like a FO4 conversation. The feeling from the games is captured perfectly, which is an achievement in itself. They even managed to transition VATs from the games in a subtle realistic but no less gory manner.Sound design was perfect, if you've played the games. You'll recognise every single sound effect from the games. From when Lucy discovers a new location to the blink and you'll miss it VATs sound effects. To Mr Handys spot on voice.The characters all felt like they were built around the role playing SPECIAL system the games are known for. Lucy the good aligned naive noob fresh out the vault. Maximus the dim soldier who is in it for the power armor. And then the Ghoul, the maxed level wastelander who just mercs everyone because he's been at it for so long.Also as a hetero male, The Ghoul gave me confused feelings. Like how did they take a species known as basically decaying radiated zombies and turn one of them into this charismatic sexy monster you can't help but be endeared to.I suppose a low point could be the story is pretty basic but like the games, it's about the adventure getting from A to B and all the side quests inbetween. ""Thou shalt get distracted by b******* every damn time"". No truer words spoken.Kudos to all actors and teams involved. This is how a computer game to film adaptation should be done.I've watched this series twice already and can't wait for the next season. I've been revisiting the games as well. Happy wastelanding everyone.",9
Fallout's back babyyyyy,"Really enjoy this series, the plot, the characters, the acting, were really on point, they really adapt perfectly the vibe from the games, although there were some minor retcons (and no, I'm not talking about that one), and some scenes that felt akward in their presentation, they weren't that big of a deal. I was kinda worried in episode 2 and 3 cause I didn't liked them so much, but after that, they hit really strong, and the finale was well done, and it had major implications for the franchise going forward, but we still don't know the whole picture, so we'll see how they carry on in future seasons.",8
Hits the aesthetic and tone,"Have played the games since #1 and I think it hits the right tone and aesthetic. The games have shifted and evolved with time, but I'm surprised at how many other commentators claim the series isn't dark enough or too funny. All the Fallouts were weird *especially* the original isometric ones (1 and 2). The Brotherhood of Steel, the vault dwellers, raiders, and quirky side characters are all true to the games. The over the top gonzo violence and the retrofuture dystopia are also straight from the game. The series song choices of 50s crooners set to a new context also is true to the game. The weird macguffin story setting the vault dwelling protagonist out on a quest to the surface (a quest she really doesn't understand the context for) is also totally fallout.So it works. This is fallout. They nailed the vibe spot on and the story and characters are well cast.",8
"Great potential, not fully realized..","I know people love the show and I'm happy for them!I started my adventure with the series (Fallout 1 and 2) around the year 2000. The show, while going for the Bethesda esthetics, is quite close to the whimsical and satirical tone of the original games. I respect that.But it failed to involve me with its story. I like the characters, but the plot is a bit aimless, full of side quests and random characters (just like the games). So by capturing the games' vibes and esthetics very well, the show failed to capture my interest. I guess it's ironic that I was tired of it being so close to the games, but I'm looking for different stuff in games and shows. It winked too much, trying to say ""see, we get that!""...The casting is great and Walton Goggins is the highlight of the show. Lucy is lovely, but I couldn't care less about her story. Only her brother's plot got me interested, possibly because I like underdog characters and a bit of detective/mystery vibe (knowing the games I was aware where it was going, but still enjoyed it).So for me it was a fun time, but more like eating at a burger joint. Everything was fine, but it didn't blow my socks off.Still, I'm happy so many people love it :)",6
Totally Surprised,"Having hundreds of hours playing the 5 (true) Fallout Games I was not looking forward to this - as a TV show cannot match the fun I had exploring this world.Well, the people behind this have managed it somehow.This doesn't have total fidelity to the game lore but I think that was needed to make the transition between medias.This pushes the comedy element quite hard but it worked for me.The production is great and the characters are amazing. Ella Purnell is perfect as is Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten - but everyone is great.The only gripe I had was that the end battle was a little lacklustre.But overall I really enjoyed this and are anticipating the next season
.",9
Solid 7,"I cut my teeth with Fallout New Las Vegas but it is Fallout 4 I really love. This series captures essence of the FO world and does so in a way that makes you want more and not just tickle your memberberries. The use of flashbacks to the world before compliments the present day story.I am a harsh critic of modern storytelling but the story building here is intriguing, characters interesting with little issues that I would call foul. In fact, the only dialog issue I had was in episode 6 when Maximus and Lucy are in vault 4 holding cell. Lucy asks Maximus if he wants to get it on. Her asking that and his response are totally uncalled for and has no place in the story.My only other critique, the Brotherhood isn't developed well and Maximus place within them seems very strange. Although the actor playing Maximus does a great job, it seems they don't know what to really do with him. One moment he is a likeable guy and another a future serial killer, you know, the quiet guy who stares creepily at you.As I watch the series for a second time I would also add, stop with all the cameos. If they are not a main character don't use well known actors for bit roles.I look forward to season 2.",7
Average at most,"There's good and there's not so good things, subjectively speaking ofc, and the not so good things make me question if I want to continue after the second episode.The good - the plot's arch sparks some interest by leaving some things hanging that engage the viewer. The structure of the narration seems to work fairly well. The world is build okay, it's not bad.The not so good - the characters lack personal depth. They feel like action movie characters. Fair enough, this seems like largely action based series, although somewhere labeled as drama. The world could be more grim. The humour often feels lazy, unimaginative and immature.This feels like an action game turned into a film, not a film based on a game. This feels shallow. Granted, I've only played the two first Fallout games, so maybe this series stays more loyal to the latter ones, but I really don't feel like this cartoonish action-based approach would convey the spirit of the two first. And beyond being a Fallout game on a film, this series seems to have little to offer to anyone else than the fans of the games.",3
Enjoyable Ride!,"With close to 1,000 hours in Fallout: New Vegas, and just a bit shy of that total in Fallout 3, I was a little nervous about watching this series. So many disappointments from so many game related movies and TV shows in the past. But I was more than pleasantly surprised by Fallout the series, and enjoyed all 8 episodes.Though others complained about the ""atmosphere"", I found it very believable for California's southern coastline. You aren't going to get the urban sprawl of downtown Washington D. C., nor are you going to get the bleached desert of New Vegas. Instead, get a lot of beach sand, blown inland from the nuclear explosions, covering the ruins of L. A. and it's surrounding area. The series stays away from a lot of dungeon crawling, or wandering through the wrecks of buildings, which actually only make up a small part of the gaming environment. They did a very nice job of portraying the vaults, which I really loved. The depiction of Brotherhood of Steel was a little harsh, at least to my tastes, as I never encountered them being quite so harsh in either Fallout 3 or New Vegas, but each chapter could be different depending on the circumstances surrounding it, so I was able to accept that.The genius of the series was the casting of Walton Goggins as Cooper Howard, as he was spectacular in the part. The rest of the cast was pretty good for a TV show, but nobody really stood out. Ella Purnell was good as the lead character, but not great. Too much of a tendency to overact the cheesy vault girl parts. Aaron Moten never really convinced me of his character until about episode 8. He just seemed bewildered and weak. Moises Arias was very good in the small scenes that he had. The rest of the case was just ""ok"", neither adding or subtracting much from the story.All in all, though, I found the series a very fun ride, and hope they can keep it up for a second season.",10
Best Game-to-Movie/Series Adaptation Ever,"In my professional opinion, this adaptation of a game into a movie or television series is the best one out there. It provides a unique perspective, akin to experiencing gameplay through the eyes of different characters. This approach is likely to resonate with gamers and appeal to non-gamers alike, transcending the boundaries of gaming enthusiasts. Furthermore, its broader appeal extends to science fiction enthusiasts, ensuring wider audience appreciation. All the actors have done justice to their roles. The CGI could have been slightly improved in certain scenes, but that may be overly critical.",10
Surprisingly good,"I don't have any prior knowledge when it comes to this show, so my enjoyment of it was quite a surprise. The writers did a great job setting the stage and giving novices a sense of this world. The acting is stellar with interesting characters that grab you right away, especially Cooper, Lucy and Maximus. Gets really nice to see Leslie Uggams on screen again, she is great. I haven't finished the season; it will be interesting to delve more into Lucy and Cooper and the groups in the bunker. I'm really glad they went through Cooper's backstory, and I hope that we get more about Lucy's father, if and when she finds him.",10
Amazing...,"Long time i didn't enjoy a show like thisAmazing from all aspect
I love it !!! Waiting for 10 more season !!Its not boring , alot of things happen in the same time , each episode somthing new , alot of creativity and idea , fun action masteries kind of showRecommended 100% , tho i never play the game but i enjoy it alot , i try to play the game but its really old dated game i dont enjoy the graphicCast is amazing , everyone did his part , graphic is amazing , cant wait to see more of this show i feel sad when irs finish ! This days u cant find a good quality show like this anymore so thank u !",9
I was pleasantly surprised,"My husband plays fallout, so we were planning to watch it, but I wasn't expecting much. This show is my favorite and I was impressed with the story, the style, costumes, scenery and special effects. I think the actor playing the ghoul is amazing. The casting director did a good job selecting the actors for the many unique roles. I hope this awesome series wins many awards for best actor/actress, director, Makeup artists, costume designers, writers....there is something in this show for anyone. There is action, suspense, a mystery, romance, comedy, drama. This series will keep you hooked.Cannot wait for next season.",10
love it!,"So far love this show! The production quality is high. They've created an immense world, not like the game, but very similar. It has great potential to expand the story lines. If they continue with the current one, I think it'll be wildly successful. The world has endless possibilities. The end surprise was a but much. It does touch on the evil ideology of transhumanism. So that's a plus! I'm surprised they put it in the show, maybe the msm is trying to continue their psyop for future events. At least that what it seems like with a trend in transhumanism being depicted. I'm excited for another season.",10
I've never seen a bigger echo chamber for a mediocre show,"I just finished this series. The writers took the goofiness of the games and copy/pasted it over into the show, expecting game goofiness during horrific events to translate well over to show goofiness during horrific events. This is a similar flavor as the ""horror comedy,"" which I think is an abomination, save a few rare examples. Like during a massacre, one of the vault leaders is more concerned about the caterers bringing out the jello too early. I mean, he's literally being chased by a machete wielding maniac when he says this. That's the kind of mood-killing cringe that peppers through this show. You know that feeling where you get invested in a mediocre show? And you know there's better things to watch out there, but you aren't invested in those; you're invested in this mediocre show, and you know it's not going to get better, but too bad, you're invested. That's what watching Fallout felt like.The backgrounds, effects, and general world building is pretty cool, and definitely captures that Fallout vibe. I give it a 7 because of the nostalgia, but if I hadn't played the games then I imagine this would be a 5 or 6.",6
Must Watch,"I am a big fan of the game series and this translated to screen seamlessly. This truly feels like a mission in the game and its original, the storyline feels fresh, the CGI is incredible! I commend Bethesda Studios for stepping into.Brilliantly capturing the essence of its video game origins while delivering a fresh, riveting narrative that stands firmly on its own. This series, which seamlessly blends drama, action, and intricate world-building, is a shining example of how to adapt a beloved game into a stunning television experience.The character development is nothing short of exceptional. Each character is multi-dimensional, with backstories and motivations that unfold organically throughout the series.",10
It's fine,"The real star of the show is the production design, which is spot on perfect and looks just like the game - it is what's holding the whole thing together. Walton Goggins is another stand out as the Ghoul; he is the real protagonist if you ask me. The other 2 main characters aren't really that engaging and feel more tacked on to get the plot moving, especially Maximus, who only seems to be there to justify having the Brotherhood in there at all.They try to cram so many things into these 8 episodes that it's hard to get attached to anything other than the guy who is present in nearly all of it. The writing is okay at best and veers into Marvel-esque dialogue at worst. The direction is mostly quite flat and boring, but the story picks up towards the end with a few reveals that will have an interesting effect on the next game should they remember it 15 years down the road.All in all, it's not bad but there's a lot of wasted potential. I'm still interested to see where they take it with the second season, which is bound to be greenlit.",6
slow disjointed start left me cold,"Before I say anything about Fallout, I want to correct all the people who keep thinking West World's Jonathan Nolan created or wrote it. He just directed the first three episodes. That's it. This show was created by a TV comedy writer and a film writer whose credits are generally unexceptional.Now, on to the review of the first episode, which is all I've watched.While the brilliant videogame Fallout 3 established the premise and built the world quickly and threw you into an exciting world, the TV series starts as an episodic mess. There's a pre-apocalypse scene that's a decent beginning, followed by 15 tedious minutes of scene building, then some over-the-top violence, then a new, uninteresting character in an uninteresting place, then a tiny bit of plot movement, and finally a little more violence. At the end of over an hour of this, there was literally nothing in the story or the characters that made me want to watch more.The movie is good looking. The 50s soundtrack does a nice job of capturing the lost-in-time aspect of the world. Ella Purnell seems like she might make a decent heroine.But it is beyond me why people are so ecstatic about this series. I looked at reviews for episode 1, to see if maybe it was a low-rated episode compared to the rest, but nope, people really liked it. And I didn't understand what they see that I don't.My recommendation is, play Fallout 3, which is amazing. (Or perhaps one of the others, but that's the only one I've played for reasons that have to relevance to this review.) But I can't recommend this show.",5
"Great show, easy to watch if you haven't played the games","As someone who has no knowledge of the games and has never played them I was a bit apprehensive going into this series. I thought I would not understand a lot of it, or that I even would outright dislike it. However, being the sci-fi nerd I am, I instantly fell in love with the first episode. Overall I think the first and last episodes of the first season are the strongest, where the middle 6 have meandering moments that follow a lot of the same post-apocalyptic tropes of other films and series. Because of that I think this show could be better, and it definitely has potential to do so. But it was a great watch and should be entertaining to anyone who likes this vibe from a film/series. 8/10.",8
Portrays the World of Fallout PERFECTLY,"I am only currently at Episode 4 but I have to say that the wait was worth it. This PERFECTLY depicts the World of Fallout in all of horrible realism and grittiness.The events that i have seen so far, while graphic, is what I have always imagined would happen in a Post-Nuclear apocalypse in the U. S. ...Desperation, Depravity, spiced up with the world within the Vault-Tec Vault and the experiences of someone coming from that pristine environment to the endless horrors and hopelessness of the wastelands straight out of Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4.I purchased 3 Months of Amazon Prime Ad-Free just for ""Fallout"" and I have to say, it was money WELL Spent.",10
Beat thing running,"Fallout seriously impressed me. I truly thought there was nothing good left out there. I mean, Walton Googins is just a beast. I'd probably watch paint dry if he was the one doing the painting but seriously it has some potential. Everyone else is the cast started growing on me as well, even the lead who i thought would have better played by the chick feom inside job and castle rock
There are definitely unanswered questions that the writers were able to push off to the second season so great for them but it's nothing that ruined or made the season 1st cliffhanger unbearable. I look forward to seeing what happens next season and how they pull everything together.",10
Walton Goggins as the ghoul the perfect fit,"After playing the game and besides a wonderful cast of the best actors; Walton Goggins, Aaron Moten, and Ella Parnell, I don't think I have enough space to write it all. Definitely better than I imagined and love how they portray the game. Bethesda created a timeless product with FALLOUT SHELTER so many years ago. The timing today is sublime, the Ghoul is probably the attraction of the series, because Walter Goggins is a genius, (my favorite character in the series JUSTIFIED) Ella and Aaron also perfectly casted. Aaron captures the lost boy, wanting to fit in and the PTSD from his childhood well. Ella is a convincing naïveté, although she's a bit too cute still, but that adds to the gaming experience because there's so much sarcasm in the game. Can't wait to see how the next season looks. I hope they continue to frame this around the game experience. I never took the theme of the game serious because it was just a fun way to pass time. After seeing the series; the theme for the game Fallout Shelter now seems pretty dark and evil. It's fun to watch. Some of these reviews are stupid and I realize it's not to be taken as an accurate depiction of the game. I played all versions of the games. But at the end of the day, I watch this stuff because I'm killing time between the drudgery of day to day. Just take it for what it's meant to do and that's entertain. It's not a documentary about the apocalypse or real life. It's a game dammit.",10
Could be great if the plot wasn't an afterthought,"I'm not a die-hard Fallout fan (played only New Vegas) so not gonna clutch the pearls over the show deviating from the lore/source material. In fact from what I heard, in some cases that might even be a good thing, when it comes to Bethesda's takes on the franchise.What I do care about is a solid story that has a fair amount of logic behind it and believable and sensible characters. And in that regard, the show is just a mess.The plot is unnecessarily convoluted, with past and present stumbling onto each other, and most of the key characters' motives remaining unclear pretty much up until the last episode of S1, which ends with a weak and ridiculous pop. And after that a lot of questions are still left to the viewer's best guesses and hopes that it will get resolved in the following episodes.Overall I don't understand the allure of these types of twisted narrations where the viewer is supposed to not understand a good half of what's going on on the screen. How is that satisfying to anybody? Why can't you just write some believable and relatable characters, surviving in the wasteland, making tough choices, and ""leveling up,"" just like the game?Or take ""The Boys"" - there is an element of mystery but most of it is pretty clear and fair to the spectator, and that doesn't hurt the show.7 for the acting, scenery, VFX, camera work and gore. With these writers and showrunners, if the series goes on, I assume it will only get worse.",6
NOT DISAPPOINTING!,"I have found in Fallout a really good storytelling, with well-interpreted characters that, on more than one occasion, catch your interest and leave you wanting to know more. I was truly surprised by the quality of the entire production.At some points, the plot outcome was a bit more predictable than others, but not in a way that spoils the story; rather, it felt logical. Frankly, I am welcoming this adaptation with open arms. For those reading this, my key words are NOT DISAPPOINTING. Give it a try, and you might like it as well. Video games are definitely not easy to adapt into other media, but in this case, WELL DONE!",8
Meh... It's ok.,"The problem with this is that the majority of positive reviews are from gamers who have grown up with the franchise to then see it blossom into a TV/Streaming thing... They absolutely love it... It's probably a wet dream for them...I've never played the game, so It's ok. Not great. Just ok.It's a fairly decent story, with multiple viewpoints and hero/villain backstories thrown in. The sets and visuals are as good as you'd expect from a big budget TV show... Although there is nothing new or overly special as I guess they were trying to stick to the game environments.The story is captivating for the first few episodes.... Then you lose interest. The series is all aiming towards a big culmination which never quite gets there so Amazon can do another series...It's good. Could be better. I
've got to the end and thought it's not worth the 8 odd hours I put in to it. Probably won't watch the next series.",6
Non fans of the games steer clear.,"Weak as hell. The first episode grabs your attention with compelling concept and decent acting, but the premise wears thin almost immediately. Couldn't take more than 10 minutes of the second episode before I had to shut it off. For a show based on A video game, you'd think they would have the resources to utilize CG where needed. Instead, one of the main focal points of the show is a ""knight"", just geeky powerarmor click bait, lumbering around in a Comicon grade suit, ridiculously clunky and slow, every movement looks laborious and weak. Straining just to take a step one second, then in the next shot, propelling another character superhero style hundreds of feet. At one point, the suit is attacked by a wild irradiated bear, that apparently has adamantium claws, as it leaves huge gashes in the metal armor. Just awful.Decent acting from a couple of the characters, decent, casting choices, and decent production values, hence the three star rating. But ludicrous premises, gigantic plot holes, clunky pacing, and generally just unI'm happy this is fulfilling, the expectations of the fans, but for anyone not blinded by their allegiance to the series, this is week tea.",3
THE GHOUL!!!!!!,"Never played the game but when i started watching this show i was hooked , best character for me was ghoul. He got the style and charisma. Cinematography is amazing, I could have done with more scenes with different creatures but i am hoping that could happen in next season. There was no forced foreshadowing and everything came out naturally. Scenes in the past were well integrated with future events. The way show depicts antagonists actually makes you feel angry and frustrated with them unlike most of other shows where it is just old washed up motives. This show could be best adaptation of a game by far.",10
Really Enjoyable - Especially if you're a fan of the games,"So with standards set fairly low from previous series stemming from video games, i wasnt expecting much, but surprisingly this was a really good series! The SFX in this is amazing to get things to look how you would imagine should you play the games.The Good: A good storyline thats fun and easy to follow. Theres no episodes which drag on or you find boring, sometimes in series theres action in the first 1/2 episodes then the rest is fairly dull. Theres alot of things set in season 1 that leave you eager to learn more in season 2, not just leaving the story just chasing 1 thing over and over.If you've played the games they've put alot of references in from the game franchise, even down to the little details like weapons and food from the games.The Bad: There really isnt any!",10
"Best video game adaptation ever, but some incredibly poor writing is keeping it from being one of the best shows ever.","I mean it, this is by far the best video game adaptation ever. It's actually still very hard to believe that it's as good as it is. It's in my opinion far superior to the overhyped, critically acclaimed TLOU adaptation by HBO (see my review of that show for why).Our main characters
1. Lucy MacLean: Ella Purnell is an absolute treat, her acting is fantastic and her giant eyes and soft voice fit perfectly with the character she's playing. She looks like a vault-tec bobble head turned into the cutest girl in the best possible way. She's not the stereotypical Disney strong woman trope that everyone is sick and tired off. Instead she is still incredible capable and combat trained but also very femine at the same time. Generally she's not unrealistically strong in combat. She's not throwing around men twice her size with ease, but she can defend herself, is a very good shot and uses her wit, charm and also her ""lawful good"" personality to survive. Strangely, everyone but Maximus seems to ignore her good looks in the wasteland. When I imagine it's rare to see someone that pretty. It's a breath of fresh air to see a woman as the protagonist be feminine in a show again.2. The Ghoul AKA Cooper Howard: Mr Goggins delivers absolute gold as always. The ghoul is a relentlessly brutal character who has at the start lost most of his humanity. We later learn his drive to live comes from the fact that he's looking for his family. The acting is incredible as always. The makeup and cgi for his ghoul version look great (maybe a little smooth). Cooper has no chill, he's not just quick to defend himself. But also to kill innocents with no remorse. 200 years in the savage wastelands have turned him into something that isn't a monster but has little humanity left. No sympathy for anyone and a singular drive. To the point where he eats former friends for substanance, kills those offering him a job. And even after Lucy shows him a kindness, ""her golden rule"" (treat others as you'd want to be treated) and saves him after he tries to sell her to organ harvesters, tortures her and even cuts her finger off. He murders a young boy in cold blood infront of his father and child sister, after he taunts him about having murdered his older brother earlier. Goating the kid into pulling a rifle. When in reality, a rifle bullet seems to literally do nothing to Cooper. Which is kind of a problem, Ghouls in the show have rapid healing abilities and Cooper esp seems to be indistructable. But the rules aren't clear.3. Maximus: Aaron Moten's Maximus is probably the weakest link. Mainly because his acting feels so inconsistent and at first I couldn't put my finger on it. It's like he's cycling through emotions or facial expressions constantly and it's very distracting. In more emotional scenes this kinda looks unhinged. For example, the interrogation scene he looks like he's about to snap, to a point that I thought it was the point. That he was going to snap and turn into some brotherhood zealot radical and an antagonist. Use everyone around him as a ladder to reach his goals. Instead he's an insecure guy looking for a place to belong and looking to be a hero. To save people. Which is fine. Great even. But his acting just never felt right. And I think I get why that is after having seen some interviews with him. He's very, very feminine in his mannerisms and facial expressions in real life. And in the show his character is trying to act a lot more masculine and straight. But his true self keeps breaking through his acting, the behavior I confused for cycling through emotions was him making his natural facial emotions but then changing them to fit his role more, but not always being able to keep the face straight. He will constantly slightly protrude his upper or lower lip and have this weird stare in certain scenes. One of the worst examples and also one of the worst scenes in the whole show is the scene where Lucy offers to sleep with him. And I think he's supposed to look shocked, a little scared and shy. But instead he comes off like he's a little girl, weirdly pouts his lips and pulls his shoulders together etc. And the dialogue being ridicilously infantile doesn't help ""with some guys their penis grows and explodes like a pimple"" or something. What? He's an adult man. He lives in barracks with men, women, trans people etc In fact in one scene a guy is clearly mastrubating under the covers. There is NO way in hell a man wrote that line. In fact, right after writing that I checked the writer for the episode. And it's a lady called Karey Dornetto. They really need to stop this nonsense where they have every episode written by a different writer. It makes the show/story feel super inconsistent.The writing
It's really good at many parts.. For example a lot of the comedic bits and humor were great. Some of the lines are fantastic. But it's also horrifically bad at other times. And I mean beyond how weird it is that Lucy would casually asks Maximus to sleep with her in a room with a giant window, in a strange place, surrounded by strange people. I thought it was funny she was asking about sperm count etc in the vault. But that made sense. Just randomly inviting people to have sex with no protection etc in that weird condition? Was that supposed to be empowering or something? Or just a set up for the pimple penis joke or Maximus later asking if she'd like to ""explode his D now."" Beyond all that, the motivations for NONE of the antagonists make any sense1. The corporations: Vault-tec wants to wipe out all the competition, on a larger scale. Wipe out literaly every faction, country, group, political entity and organization so there won't be anyone to fight or compete anymore. Total domination by one group, one faction: Vault-Tec. How? By a nuclear holocaust. By dropping the bombs themselves. But that's just part of the plan. They know it won't wipe out everyone. Their plan is to, wait for it..... Wait it out.. their plan is that everyone on the surface eventually dies. How? Time. But .. that makes no sense? They'd multiply and start rebuilding naturally, right? Nope.. don't think about it. ""The greatest weapon of mass destruction is time"" according to vault-tec in this show. But it gets better. Vault-Tec then invites all their competitors.. to join in on the fun. Because obviously the best way to end competition. Is to tell your competition of your plans an invite them to join you in the new future you're planning to create. But wasn't the point .. that there'd be no more factio- SHHHH, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT! Oh and the vault experiments.. well those are now made up by different corporations for their own end goals, that they are allowed to choose for some reason. In the game lore it's the enclave who was convinced the nuclear war would was inevitable and would make the world uninhabitable, so they planned to create multi generation star ships and colonize different planets. Most of the vaults were meant as experiments to see how people would last in long term confinement and or to create some super human species etc etc and a small amount of them were control groups and thus had no experiments etc going on.Listen, I'm fine with the corpos dropping the bomb, even though it ruins the ambigiouty we had about who dropped them. I don't mind vault tec's somewhat cartoony power hunger and motivations. That's totally fine in fallout. But the bad writing, the plotholes, the inconsistency .. that's unacceptable. These people are supposed to be professional writers, and they couldn't come up with something better? OR just stuck to the game lore? Same for characters, it's ok for them to be whacky and over the top. It's fallout. But there is a limit to what works and what is just infantile and dumb.2. Lucy's parents: So Lucy's dad is a lower level cog in the Vault-Tec machine and he's assigned to live his life out in a vault, herding the flock. All the Vault 31 people are cryopod people from before the bomb. This doesn't seem enough of a revelation for vault 32 to break out into a full on civil war and massacre each other. But that does seem to be the extent of it.Moldaver's talk about Lucy's mom Rose was cringe worthy. Oh, how smart and mary sue she was. She inferred from the vault losing water, that it was being siphoned. She didn't assume it was a leak or anything. No it had to be that civilization had restarted and their water was being siphoned by them. How did they siphon the .. water of a vault? Wouldn't that be a design fla-- don't think about it! You're not supposed to think! Look, I'm not looking for much logic, but, what? And then when she tells her husband, and he says .. probably just a leak. She figures he's must be hiding something? In a vault full of people that are bred to be docile and nice to each other? She has no idea what's there. It might be a leak, it might be a bunch of monsters or raiders, the radiation is still there etc etc. What does she do? She takes her children and .. leaves the vault. She takes her children to an irradiated wasteland to live in an irradiated town among mutants, raiders, murderers, and under constant threat of monsters, other factions, radiation etc It's implied she has a romantic relationship with Moldaver and that Shadysands was this super great, perfect place where civilization had thrived etc. What? I mean sure there was more safety than other places and the NCR was in power etc. But it was still the fallout world with raiders and tons of hostile factions, cannibals, ghouls, monsters, radiation in every part of the world etc.The father than, get this. Goes and takes the children. And then. He NUKES the town. How does a mid level management tool from a corpo nuke a whole town you ask? Don't. Because we're never told. He just does.There is much more, but it appears we've run out of the characer limit. Overall, I really enjoyed the show. But it could have been so much better.",8
Sets a new standard for video game adaptations,"Whether you are a fan of the games or know nothing about them, Fallout does an amazing job satisfying both types of viewers. The creators of the series made the brilliant decision to create a new story in the Fallout universe that can coexist with all the games. Director, writer and producer Jonathan Nolan made it clear that he didn't want to drastically change any of the established lore but instead contribute to it and he accomplishes that goal remarkably.We follow 3 main characters on their journeys across the remnants of Southern California in a retro-futuristic nuclear fallout. The switching of perspectives from across a 200 year period of time is done often but the transitions are seamless and warranted. All the characters connect with each other in ways that feel natural. Some of the story arcs are deceivingly complex while others are mysterious in nature which will have you wanting to start a new episode as soon the current one you're on ends. Even the side stories involving supporting characters were compelling and led to some of the best moment in the entire season.The action, humor and drama in the series is evenly placed. Prime Video spared no expense when it came to the costume design, graphics and post apocalyptic alternate history setting.Fallout proves you can tell an original story without changing the core of the material to attract new viewership. In sticking with this idea, Prime Video set a new standard for future video game adaptions to follow.",10
Wanted.,"Eh. Where do we begin?Based on a game series I love and the show so far is great. Earns an 8.Mostly because it doesn't seem to knacker the lore completely and at the most adds a wealth of characters that are worth following.If anything it makes one like me ask questions and wonder - which is a good recipe in my book.To the uninitiated to the games it's probably a weird mash of fun, confusion and maybe a bit of an acquired taste, but reckon it should prove fairly entertaining to the target crowd.A lot happens, relationships are built, things get killed - run of the mill maybe, but a quality execution nonetheless......nonetheless -
I'd say or hope season one is a testing ground for such an ambitious project. And it really seems to be as far as I can tell.I can't deny that there are quite a few things from the game series I would have expected to see - such as:
Energy Weapons - What, no lasers? Not even with the BOS being very prominent -
Stealth Boy - Norm cudda used one?More Creatures - A Gulper? Hmmmm...
Robots - Just a Mr Handy? Hmmmm...Yet... I get the constraints, no easy job pulling all of this off for the game fans. Only so much you can do.Overall, it was properly entertaining with much to laud... Introduced new stuff to the lore that makes 'fair enough' sense, had quite a few great set-pieces and brought in characters that catch your attention -Especially like Lucy - as if Level 1 on leaving the vault(s) and maybe Level 6 (?) by the end of the series.Hope they continue this arc. Reckon she'll be a top level courier-like-chosen-one badass by the end... perhaps...But til then... It's just season one and well worth a watch - and perhaps a rewatch too.Maybe season two will earn a 9 but it will need lasers.",8
What is the rating criteria for this TV Series?,"I love the actors and they do a great job BUT without knowing the history of the video game, it misses people like me. I realize the phenomenal gamers may be enthusiastic about the video game being made into a TV Show but sadly, I missed the boat. The TV Show didn't do enough to get me (the non-gamer/viewer) up to speed.I understand that this TV SERIES is base on a video game BUT this is not a video game at this vantage point; it is a TV Series and this TV Series does not deserve anything past a 7. An 8.5 makes me the think the writer, creator, or their friends were the ones voting. This series is 'good' but it is not spectacular. Who is rating this TV Show? Please educate those of us that are not gamers but love the actors.",7
AWESOME SERIES!,"First of all, you don't need to have played the game to watch the show!The series was set up perfectly to stand alone as well as having tonnes of references for fans of the game.The set, costumes and characters are fantastic. Each episode draws you in. My partner and I ended up watching the full series within a couple of nights. As a fan of the game, he was very impressed!Walton Goggins plays such a great role as the ghoul. He's brilliant in other things I've watched like Predators & Sons of anarchy, so I was so excited to see him in this. He's definitely my favourite character!Ella Purnell played Lucy so well! Loved seeing her in a lead role after Yellowjackets. I love the dynamic between Lucy & the Ghoul!So excited for a season 2!",9
This is overrated,"Sorry for all the fans, I've never play the game. This show is good but, I feel like they didn't dive enough into the personalities of the character, the conversations aren't very interesting, it feels a bit like a soap show. I literally forced myself to finish the show because I saw the great reviews and was hoping for a chocking ending, and I wasn't astonished. But I truly loved the location and the movie set It felt like it was a tv show from an other time. You can't feel that human's lived on this planet a while ago, thumbs up to the crew. Am I the only one feeling like this show is overrated ?",7
"Fallout is like a 1950s canned soup: All the ingredients are there, but the result is bland and boring","Fallout has all the makings of a great show. It has a talented cast, a big budget, and a team of experienced writers and producers. But somehow, the show manages to be both boring and forgettable.The problem is that Fallout is all style and no substance. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the plot is predictable and cliched. The show also suffers from a serious case of tonal whiplash, veering wildly from comedy to drama to action without any real sense of cohesion.As a result, Fallout is a show that is easy to watch but difficult to care about. You might find yourself watching an episode and then immediately forgetting everything that happened. It's the kind of show that you'll never binge-watch or even rewatch.It's a shame that Fallout is such a disappointment. With all the talent and resources behind it, it should have been a lot better. But instead, it's just another forgettable entry in the ever-growing sea of TV shows.",5
A Masterpiece,"This show was life-changing for me. I genuinely think it was perfect, simultaneously creating it's own story while pulling elements from the games. The story building and the character writing is phenomenal, and the actors/actresses fit their roles so well and played their characters to perfection. Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Aaron Moten and Moisés Arias were the perfect leads and I can't wait to see them in the next season. The score was amazing as well, of course. The build-up to the season finale was suspenseful and kept you wanting more, and the finale itself was powerful and epic. I highly recommend if you are a fan of the games or dystopian stories in general.",10
Epic Sci-Fi At Its Very Best!,"Don't worry if you've never played any of the numerous Fallout games that there have been over the years. The team who made this series have got you covered with some great back story flashbacks. If you are a fan of the games then I suspect you might fall in love with this series like I did.No spoilers here - just a simple review. The plot is based around survivors of ""The Great War"" which pretty much ended civilisation for those not selected to be ""saved"" in one of dozens if not hundreds of underground bunkers. This is their story seen from various different character perspectives.The visual effects are right up there with the very best and you could well believe that you are actually looking at post-apocalyptic America! Various landmarks such as LAX airport appear and the visuals take your breath away. Absolutely fantastic. The scenery is awesome and there are nods to the game everywhere from the Pip Boy wrist terminals to the guns, armour and the pre-war cars and Americana. Well done for keeping us gamers happy.Oh and the music. It's like Diamond City Radio on the big screen.",9
This is Fallout!,"How can I give less than 10 to the great world adaptation of my favorite game! Everything shines there, items, weapons, clothing, everything look exactly as in the game. The atmosphere and characters, and the same blood and humor as in the game. I was wondering if they include even such extreme things as cannibalism and they did. Lucy is my character, particularly when she went out from the Super Duper Mart in that light leather armor with my favorite 10-mm pistol looking exactly as in the game. Also, I felt the influence of the mods on the plot. When I saw Vault 4, it really reminded me one of the best mods I played. In general, the atmosphere of the series makes it all. Yes, I agree there maybe some plot holes, and the characters do not always act rationally or seriously, but again this is all about Fallout, which has never meant to have a linear plot and rational characters. The acting is great. The bad ghoul is probably taken from one of the mods as well, but it looks exactly as he should be. After watching the whole season, I can highly recommend it to anyone adult enough for this. Those who has never played the games, particularly Fallout 4, may not appreciate it enough. Moreover, there are many things in the series which assume that you played the game. Otherwise, they may be not understood. But nonetheless, the series are great on their own. Now, waiting for the second season and hoping the scenery will be Boston with its Institute.",10
What we've been waiting years for!,"A series we fans have been wanting for a long time, and whilst only just started it myself so far it has surpassed all expectations I held for this.From the outfits, to weapons and locations I'm truly in awe for what we have recieved.Amazon went all out to make this as close to the game series as possible. Whilst set in the same universe it has it's own unique cast and set of characters. Kudos to the cast and crew for making this a fabulous Fallout TV adaptation.So far I can only praise what this show is and I'm both amazed and blown away. If you've never played the games even I think this would be a series you'd enjoy, and one I recommend to you.",10
Looking forward to Season 2,"This series was a wonderful surprise. I thought after the first two episodes that it was not going to grab me, but it did from Episode 3 onward. There is something about a video game that makes me, at least, think that there can be no humanity about it. But the lead actors bring great emotion to the series. I was more than impressed with Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins in particular. They were the twin bridges that made a video based series real, and it had some not so subtle connections to the dystopian world we currently may be creating. I am disappointed that apparently we will have to wait until 2026 to see Season 2. I hope there is something that can be done about that. Anyone out there listening?",8
"Surprisingly Well-Executed Tone and Style, For a TV Show","Let's just get this out of the way: TV adaptations of beloved movie/anime/video game franchises often SUCK, and our expectations have been lowered so far that they're buried next to dinosaur dirt. Consequently, surpassing that bar is not a very tall order.That said, Fallout (2024) is a breath of fresh air in the endless hell of streaming adaptations we're forced to endure year-after-year.By far the greatest praise of this show is that it nails the TONE. The Fallout franchise is such a specific blend of Pax Americana, retro-futurism and post-apocalyptic dark comedy that this series seemed doomed to fail, as no one but Bethesda has been able to replicate that tone in such a specific way. Like many others, I believed this would just be another half-assed cash grab preying on the nostalgia of middle-aged gamers.However, I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself eagerly jumping to the next episode! The tone is absolutely PERFECT. Although the ""Mad Max-esque"" future is grim and downright horrifying at times, its subtle blend with comedy and humanity is 100% spot-on.Somehow (surely by black magic or otherworldly incantations) the show isn't a total mess! Heck, it's even downright enjoyable at times! The characters are properly developed and experience real narrative arcs throughout the season. Motivations make sense and there are real stakes for our (anti?)heroes. The sets and costumes are high quality, genuinely lived-in and believable. There is actual visual style and thought behind the cinematography. Clearly the creators held the games in high regard, and fans will certainly smile along seeing this homage play out on the screen.Though there is much praise, it still manages to fall into some of the familiar trappings of generic streaming tripe (hence the 8/10). Some characters and motivations inevitably fall flat. While gore seems to unabashedly flourish in this post-apocalyptic hellscape, the ever looming prudish censorship of the FCC makes this story a largely loveless one. Chemistry between main characters is always played for laughs, with no intent to establish any kind of serious connection between our protagonists.There is also what I considered to be some ""filler episodes."" While this ties in nicely to Fallout's theme of constantly getting distracted/sidetracked by random nonsense, the joke does wear a little thin when we only have 8 episodes to explore this specific story. If instead they would've spent this time further fleshing out the characters, I believe the narrative payoffs would have been much more significant.All-in-all it was a very enjoyable evening spent watching this show (praise Amazon for releasing it all at once!). Fans of the game will surely find themselves engaged and get a few laughs. Even the uninitiated will likely bond with the main characters over their struggles and triumphs in this nightmarish vision of a post-nuclear American wasteland.IMO worth watching at least the first episode or two for anyone curious; if you find yourself chuckling along with the dark humor - you may want to give the Fallout series a chance!",8
"Solid in some aspects, not good in others","Overall word building and set design was excellent. You can clearly tell Johnathan Nolan and co are fans of the property. Acting is passable with a couple no so great performances that may have more to do with lackluster writing than fault of the actors. Walton Goggins brings tons of charisma and his performance as The Ghoul is one of the shows biggest strengths. I really liked Lucy as a character and Ella Purnell plays a naive, can-do attitude well as she develops more into a tough, capable survivor. The Maximus character is where the shows falters a bit. The actor's performance can be a bit grating compared to Goggins and Purnell. Overall as someone with surface level experience with the Fallout franchise, I enjoyed the first season and feel they can build on this going forward.",6
Pleasantly Surprised,"The promotional videos released prior to the premiere of the show did it a slight disservice, leading many to prematurely conclude that it would be disappointing-I myself was among the skeptics. Fortunately, I decided to give the show a chance, and I'm glad I did.While it's not without its flaws, the series stands out for its originality, a quality that many shows today seem to lack. It consistently introduces fresh and interesting plot devices that ensure it never becomes dull or boring. Moreover, it possesses the potential to evolve into a masterpiece in future seasons.I highly recommend watching it.",8
Significant Pacing Problems,"Almost finished, and I am annoyed with all the reviews so far.I hate the 10/10's that blindly praise it, and the 1/10's that say it's nothing like the game. I am going to assume that they are only loosely familiar with the franchise, because it seems pretty close to the world that I was expecting. It feels pretty close to fallout in my mind.I also don't love it.The closest negative review was a comment about the graphics. The graphics are rough in spots, but that isn't the problem.The problem is pacing.Very quickly we are introduced with a McGuffin. It's very well handled and the first couple of episodes present it in a very solid way. Then it disappears, say around episode 4.Around episode 4, we are introduced to some much needed background about the world. I like this part as well.So I liked 1-4 and 4-8. Why is there a problem?They are different stories. Season 1 is the first four. Great! Season 2 is the second four? Also great. But make clear arcs.This 100% feels like they were trying to emulate a game here.1-4 is the introduction part of the game. We are, like all games, stuck on the railroad of storytelling that introduces the McGufffin. Then something happens and the world opens up.Some players just grind after the McGuffin and keep it going. Some players wander and explore creepy buildings. I personally explore creepy buildings. It's what I enjoy. It's why I enjoyed the second act. But now I am unsatisfied. I reached the end of six and realized that they were going to be only able to finish one of the two story arcs in the time remaining...Oh...yay... another cliffhanger. I guess I saw it coming at least. Don't get me wrong, I understand the need and they just didn't stick the landing. That 3-6 episode segment is rough.I have no problem with a genuinely episodic show. I have no problem with a major story driven show. But you have to be a masterclass genius to get your cake and eat it.",7
"Lazy plot, atrocious acting and terrible CGI. How the hell is this reviewing so well?","I must be going insane because I literally cannot fathom how this show has gotten anything over 5/10 by any reputable critic.The first episode was somewhat engaging, but towards the end and pretty much everything after that began to feel like I was watching an amateur theatre youth group's attempt at a video game parody. The acting is absolutely atrocious from pretty much every character. The plot is uninteresting, the CGI is terrible and the pacing is all over the place.I really hope some people with brains start watching this so the reviews start to match its actual quality, because I wasted 2 hours of my life on this thanks to the ratings it received.As a long-time fan of the Fallout series, I'm really disappointed that they couldn't find more than one competent actor for the show.",3
THE Best game adaptation ever.,"The series is a masterpiece. It captures the essence of the Fallout universe flawlessly. The humor, the hidden plotlines, the depth of sadness in a post-apocalyptic world, the stark reality of a lawless society-the complete Fallout package in a series. Iconic characters with their own motives and goals, well-written character arcs-everything you'd expect from the Fallout universe.Now, speaking of direction, it's simply impeccable. The soundtrack, use of color, camera positioning, performances, costumes (though I must say, the Pipboy and armor didn't quite convey the impression of being made of steel; they seemed more like rigid foam), the setting-it's evident that no expense was spared in creating this masterpiece.I can't thank enough for having the pleasure of watching this incredible series. If you've played the games, it's your duty to watch the series.Thank you to all the directors and executives who brought this work of art to life.",10
The best show I've ever seen,"From the very first episode to the last, every single minute of this show is absolutely captivating. The entire thing is so well done. I am in awe of just how they were able to pull everything off and it absolutely makes me want a new Fallout Single player game. The very last episode, that little plot twist I definitely didn't see that coming & my jaw hit the floor. I cannot wait to see what they do in New Vegas because that was a perfect game, and is still very much playable to this day, so I can only imagine what the writers are gonna do with that material. Hopefully, one of these days there will be a 4K Blu-ray of the series. That way I can own a physical copy of it and not just have to rely on Amazon servers all the time. Just this entire series has literally changed my perspective on everything in the real world. Corporations will do anything that they have to do to appease their investors, including selling blood clotting vaccines. The implications presented in this show definitely have far reaching effects. If this show doesn't open your eyes to what's going on around you in the real world then you are a sheep for sure.",10
Absolutely awesome,"This is the only video game to film adaptation that has ever been made that is actually Likeable, and it goes past likeable. To freaking amazing. Can't wait till season 2.I love all the little details in it that gives Easter eggs or head nods to the video game. And the writing is soo fallout like that I can see Todd Howard was definitely involved with the writing and directing. This is probably one the if not the best show I've seen so far this entire year. If you haven't watched it. But have played a single fallout game. Its a must watch. If you like action, comedy, and great world building it's a must watch.",10
"I expected to hate it, but this show is outstanding.","I am a crusty fallout player who has experienced all games from FO1 on, and I'm one of those people who like Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and New Vegas better than 3 and 4 by a long shot. After 76 I expected that every brain cell behind this property had died. I was also not looking forward to following some bland Everyman hero instead of the kind of builds people actually make in the games that let you roleplay- and BOY was I wrong.The Lucy and Norm from the vault are exactly like the INT builds I favor, the morally bankrupt gunslinging ghoul, Goggins, is almost one for one the kind of guy I made for a fresh New Vegas run to spice things up after I got tired of being a Science Hero. The Brotherhood is a faction I'm actually burnt out on and tired of- I think I'm in the fan minority here but I rolled my eyes whenever the brotherhood was shoehorned into a plot line.... So Maximus was a revelation for me. He's perfect. He's an exact spotlight into everything wrong with the Brotherhood, which they breathed new life into by making them morally grey and screwed up. I really liked them showing a wide eyed kid admiring a shiny idealized Brotherhood he made up in his head... only for the helmet to be ripped off in the rudest of ways. I also like how he's flawed and less than he appears, but that seems to go for everyone involved with his faction. He's actually interesting to watch and I thought it was impossible for me to give a fly's fart in space about anything Brotherhood.I love Lucy too, it's nice to see someone wide eyed and inexperienced who isn't a wimp by a long shot. Her brother, Norm, is also great. If I was honest with myself he acts how I'd probably act stuck in a vault, he's oh so wonderfully and terribly relatable. I love checking in on him and the wonderfully creepy people watching him from time to time.One note: as I said I'm an old fan who expected to hate this and so far it's nuked my expectations harder than it nuked Shady Sands. I don't really get the people who had a fit about this- it made sense and this is a dark setting. Even as a huge New Vegas fan I don't understand the canon fears either- New Vegas is an old game you can still boot up any time. I'm glad the show isn't completely shackling itself to old Lore like Bethesda does- that's what's been making the newer games so bland. With any luck they'll hire some writers for this for the next actual game and quit focusing on shovelware like 76.",10
So good that I hope they don't screw up S2,"Like anybody else I haven't been immune from the overflow of TV series of the last decade. 99% of the times they are too slow and even the most celebrated (no names...cough, Game of Thrones, cough) are extremely boring: it takes for five episodes for 1 small thing to happen. Fallout is on another level: the plot is interesting, evey episodes carries both news and action and the show follows a number of characters, all of whom have an interesing background and let the viewer ask him/herself about what will happen next in the storyline. Any environment and artifact is made with a realism that could compete with a movie and at a level of quality which is way above your regular series. Overall this series is a real gem, so good that my highest hope is that they don't screw up Season 2 (pls don't make endless seasons...the never endingness of tv series leaks inevitably in borerdom at some point).",10
Better than expected.. A must watch,"Best adaptation, cinematography, music and story 👍
Thanks Nolan and Amazon.Universe too is amazing, less nudity (except 1st ep., highly recommended to all family.Best adaptation, cinematography, music and story 👍

Pretty Good but thats about it,"As a fan of the game's the first thing I want to say the story was better than Fallout 4, but the characters did not leave much of an impression they were too bland except for The Ghoul and Lucy the rest were very forgettable, but The Ghoul really left an impression like he was a veteran from the games and Lucy was like someone first time playing but in a good way.They captured the feel of the world of Fallout exceptionally well, even the weapons which I wished to see more from the games but what they didn't capture very well were the monsters of fallout that felt lacking to me at least also the lack of a deathclaw was very disappointing to me.The Last Episode was kind a weird to me with the whole revelation stuff and the part with who dropped the bombs just felt like stupid writing to me and wished they just stuck to the lore.",7
You don't have to have played fallout to love this show.,I really didn't want to watch this show. I had no real interest in watching a show adapted on a game that I had never played. However my husband had it on and after around 3 minutes I was already hooked.There is so much to love about it. The sound track is really enjoyable. Especially if you love the 50's. The acting and plot are both great. In my opinion nothing lets this show down. We didn't want to stop watching. Unfortunately sleep and working got in the way of that.I'm very excited for season 2. I honestly think that this is one of the best series I have ever seen. And I'm pleased that I gave it a chance. I really don't think you have to be a gamer to appreciate this. But obviously if you've played fallout you probably have a little more insider knowledge.Highly recommend this show. 8 episodes is not enough.,10
"Nails the atmosphere, but fumbles on storytelling","This is a show made by people who love the Fallout franchise so much that everything else becomes something of an afterthought. Much like how the main character in the the Star Wars prequels is the universe itself, it is also true here. While that may be fine for Star Wars since it is a culturally defining piece of media where those films were basically complementary additions to the original trilogy, Fallout is the first live-action of its kind and for all the success the games have had over the years it falls short of that esteem. So it doesn't work.I don't want to give the impression this is a bad show. It's not. I did enjoy myself. Much of the humor lands, and the dangers found on the road plus game references were all quite fun. Costume and set design were also superb. But the hyper-focus on the setting really took away from characters and actual storytelling. Lucy, who is arguably the main character of the show, conforms far too much to her specifically engineered upbringing to stand out. Instead of adding to her characterization, she ends up blending into the background because of it. If the writers wanted to make her a real person, she should have broke or strayed away from her conditioning in a consequential way but she doesn't. Also, Maximus gets a mention for being extremely unlikeable and became ever more so as the series progressed. Just when you think he finally has a backbone after finding something to fight for he shows you he is the same as he ever was. This is a shame because Moten is a talented, convincing actor. Everyone outside of the Ghoul was relatively bland and generic, but you can't focus on him either because he is more part of the setting than someone for the audience to relate to. The point is, you basically get no one to root for, not even the main characters, and develop zero emotional attachments to anything outside of it being a Fallout show. When that hits home, the heavy-handed overuse of oldies music amidst gratuitous violence while traversing the wasteland ends up feeling a little cheap and transparent. It happens too often which reveals itself to be a targeted attempt at game nostalgia. This should be complementary to things of substance, not observed at the forefront by default because those things are not there.Additionally, what we see over the span of eight episodes doesn't stand on its own. I had thought the main plot reveal at the end would accomplish this but it doesn't. The entire thing is one big build-up to New Vegas. I like expansive arcs that cross multiple seasons, but not at the expense of what you're currently watching. It must be a complete and weighty experience on its own. This is not, and if you think so, ask yourself if it would have been fine for it to have ended here altogether.I'll likely watch the following season, but won't be anywhere near as excited as I was for this one.",6
Tired of bad scripts,"Yes it's Fallout, yes the visuals are great, yes they got the theme almost right... but come on, like every series in the last 10 years this one also has horrible writers, cliches, pre-made dialogues, scenes that are copypasted from other shows, etc etc.It gets annoying. The first Lucy scene opens up with the stupid-plot written all over it. Plot holes, logical things that nobody does because it would break the super thin credibility they want to create with the story. Yayy external visitors! But they all smell, they look bad, their manners are questionable. Nobody raise a question, but then the girl finds out they got radiation on them. So... nobody did a check before? They all had their pipboys on, were they all broken?This is the disney version of fallout, where bad guys are extremely recognisable by the audience so they can scream ""oh nooo watch oooout!""
But I'm too old for this stuff, and that's why I liked the plot in the games: it wasn't straight black and white, it wasn't predictable, it was gritty and adult and always looking in the shades of grey.Modern streaming shows are all like this, and I can't stomach them anymore.",4
Played the Game or Not - watch the show,"As the title - Played the Game or Not - watch the show. You do not need to have played the show to watch and enjoy how good this show is. They do a good job building into it with the information needed. They do a excellent job with character development as well and keep you invested. For those who have played the game you will enjoy and feel like you are back in the game as it really does it justice. There was not one disappointing episode as they all kept you hooked. We are already waiting for the next season and cant wait to see what happens next in the wasteland. Give it a chance, you wont regret it.",8
Honest review from a typical gamer,"Honestly it's hard for a show or film to make a game come to life in a live action. And I think fallout is a 10/10 show.Yes you hear people say "" where are the death claws, where's this and that. Oh what's cannon""Who cares. It's only one season and I'd much prefer to not have everything smashed together from all the games into a season or episode! The small nods and usage of references were amazing! Not over done and used well.The story I loved. And although I found Lucy's story to be great I LOVED Howard's story i personally hope he stays more of the main focus next season.I think the writers and directors should just repeat what they did and keep it going! Keep it fresh but also don't steer away from the source.The show also makes a great watch for someone who hasn't played the games.",10
Amazon has knocked it out of the park with this series,"I have played most of the Fallout games since Fallout 3, and I can attest to their deep emotional resonance and the scarring they leave once you wander the wastelands and observe the tattered remnants of humankind 200 years in the future scrambling to get out of the primordial muck the great war created.Amazon has knocked it out of the park with this series. The ambiance and atmosphere of the games are reproduced down to the bottle caps. Vast destroyed vistas, incredible violence, savage radiation mutated creatures of nightmares, the horrors of failed vaults-it's all here. The great factions of this destroyed war are well represented, barely scratching the surface of their depth. Even the beloved gas station is recreated to the finest detail, as fans of Fallout 4 will attest.Ella Purnell is incredible as the protagonist of singular courage who dares to leave the comfort of her vault to face the harsh world. Her transformation from a naive, sheltered daddy's girl to a capable survivor is interesting to watch, especially as she resists losing her instinct to do the right thing.Walton Goggins plays the quintessential cowboy ghoul, immortal and haunted by the ghosts of betrayal centuries past. His anti-hero personality makes him all the more genuine and credible, fitting for such a harsh world.Aaron Clifton plays a struggling squire seeking to become a knight, and his character development arc is also impressive. Honor and duty matter, and he shows a genuine struggle in this regard.It's disturbing yet comforting to see the desperation of the survivors, eking out an existence in this hellscape that never recovered, 200 years after the great war. Their grit and determination, optimism, and bravado are formidable. As Chet said aptly, 'We are all cowards. That's why we live in a vault.'
As with all Fallout games, the charming soundtrack is exemplary. All the great oldies are used in just the right places with the right tone and theme.",9
Prime has it's GoT,"I've never played the games so I went into Fallout with zero expectations. It blew my mind like a nuke. The production quality, scripting and casting is excellent. The satire is hilarious, and horrifying at the same time, as it presents a possible vision of a post apocalyptic future. Are we on a path to world war 3 and the end of civilisation?The retro sci-fi feel is cool. The characters are very engaging and I found myself caring about them. Like GoT bad things happen to them. The action is often brutal and graphic.Fallout is a show which people I know and work with are talking about, like when GoT was a social phenomena. A lot of people don't subscribe to Prime but the attraction of this show is so strong many will start.It will make stars out of some of the actors. Annabel O'Hagan for example who plays tragic supporting character Stephanie has a presence and a smile which is magnetic and heart melting.The Boys is great but with Fallout, Prime video finally has a show which can draw an audience like GoT.",10
Phenomenal Adaptation,"As an avid Fallout player, I was both excited and a bit worried to hear about the show. It seems like many of the recent adaptations have fallen flat and abandoned aspects of the original material which were vital to the essence of what made it special. Happily, the show exceeded my expectations and kept the violent, fun, retro atmosphere. Great casting, plot, costumes, makeup, set design, and perhaps most importantly, music. Overall, the show was very well done and remained true to the imagery of the game, albeit with some points I think could have been done differently with better effect. Ad Victoriam.",10
"A Good Concept, Ruined By Silly Stuff","This is one of those shows that could have been excellent. However, it misses the mark by introducing all sorts of silly, comedic ploys.I didn't know anything about this story before watching. It's an interesting concept, and provides an engaging story. At times, the writing is somewhat serious, and touches on a thought-worthy concept, and then... something silly happens.Comedy and thought-provoking concepts don't mix. Yet, this show attempts to deliver both, and fails; predictably.I'll never understand why writers believe this will ever work. You're dealing with two, completely separate, and opposite, emotions. So, why try to combine them? It's like trying to make someone laugh, and cry, at the same time. You can't really do both. If something's sad, it's not funny, and if it's funny, it's not sad. I'll never understand the desire to cater to opposite emotions.It's because of the silly antics that I could never recommend this show to anyone. The silliness bleeds over into some of the characters -- particularly one. I understand that writers want to portray this slick, tough, over-the-top character. However, it's not realistic; which hurts the credibility of the show.""Battlestar Galactica"" was far from perfect. However, it made a greater attempt to be serious. Because of this, it's a better show, overall. ""Fallout"" has an excellent concept to explore. It's just too bad that the creators couldn't help themselves by interjecting jokes and foolishness.I can only imagine what this show would have been had it decided to take a more serious, realistic approach, like some of the episodes of ""Black Mirror"". Had it done that, it could have been a golden classic.",6
You hardly see such a good series these days,"It was just like watching a very well made, high budget sci-fi action movie, I mean the whole series. I never expected it to be such entertaining, action poured.It startes very quickly, with magnificent scenes and actions, which is more than enough to make your blood boil and pull you into the series, then it slows down little bit to give some space to character development and to introduce the back story. Nevertheless, it dose not forget mixing some action scenes in between too, so that you don't get bored much.And, most importantly, the story is very well written, good beginning and development, and mesmerising ending. Again, I'm really surprised, wish there are more movies or series like this these days.",10
A bit overhyped,"Is it bad? No. Far from it to be honest, but the little things I don't like it about it really get to me. The first and main thing I dislike is the character Maximus, he almost makes it unwatchable. He's a liar, a hypocrite, and somehow has the best luck, with essentially zero skill. I honestly hope they kill him off. Another thing I dislike is the cringy humor that happens every so often. Some of the humor is good, but other times it feels similar to Marvels attempt at jokes. I hope the humor gets darker the next season. Other than that, it's a great show, excellent set design, music is perfect, action is great.",7
"Not bad, but MASSIVELY overhyped by fans of the games","If you love this because it's a competent live-action adaption of the video game franchise you love, more power to you. I've played one Fallout game, and even that only a short way in. I'm not grading on the nostalgia-kick curve.This show was 'okay' on some levels. The acting was solid. The effects and aesthetic are nice. It definitely reminds me of the game. Almost too much at times as it almost felt like there were alot of video game references put in that destroyed any sense that this might be a real place or story.The action is also fine, but nothing special or particularly well done. There seemed to be a certain glee in the gore and shock value of the violence, rather like Walking Dead. This glee seemed really out of place given the messaging of the show.The character work is the closest thing to interesting going on in the show. Lucy and Maximus each come to the plot with their own brand of naivete, and it is through their eyes that we learn about the world. Lucy I felt was handled better than Maximus, but they were both fine. Nothing exceptional, just fine.But then we get to the message. There are no more overwrought, overused Hollywood tropes than the hyperviolent movie that pretends it's 'anti-war' because it says so...even as it profits off of war, and the simplistic anticapitalist message...even as the show shamelessly stamps out licensed franchise content from a video game. Is there any LESS self-aware show than Fallout? Name one. You can't do it.What is particularly galling is the INCREDIBLE lack of subtlety in the tantrum-level messaging in this show. The capitalists aren't just corrupt or selfish in this show, no...they're SO EVIL that they LITERALLY plot the end of the world in order to make money. They effectively plot the deaths of their own families, though the show doesn't seem to realize it. The amount of space and the inclusion of any extended family would be precluded. These folks were plotting the deaths of their own parents, cousins, siblings, and friends. They are so evil, that even Hitler himself wouldn't match up. Hitler after all, loved his Momma.This level of cartoonishly evil villainry makes the entire plot hard to take at all seriously. But wait...that's not even the funny part. Ultimately, the society they create in the vaults...seems to be relatively classless and moneyless. It's a socialist commune! So this band of arch-fiend capitalists created a socialist paradise? One wonders if the writers of this show even proofread their own script.Ultimately, a major 'twist' that literally everyone will see coming turns a villain into the unsung heroine. The infamous Moldaver, it turns out, is trying to make 'cold fusion' available to the world. It's an odd choice since 'cold fusion' is a scam and a con in the real world. What's worse, it seems like they already HAVE real fusion in compact, easily portable cells. The world already HAS infinite cheap power! What is she really providing? It was baffling to me why anyone needed to pursue cold fusion in this world.So look, if you can ignore the comically bad messaging, Fallout isn't terrible. It's not great...or good even. It's okay. But it's REALLY hard to not roll your eyes at the messaging because this show slaps you in the face with EXTREMELY unsubtle messaging in almost every episode after the first one. It's honestly a little hard to watch UNLESS you're a dedicated fan of the video game series and you're here for your Nostalgia-Heroin. If that's what you want...yeah, I think this show delivers. The rating on this thing though is being driven by that, not the real quality of the program which was pretty 'meh' for those wanting it to stand on it's own.",5
"A Perfect Fusion: Pulp, Retro Sci-Fi, Humor, and Drama","Having completed Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Fallout 4, I initially expected to dislike this series, but I found myself binge-watching it through the night.The Fallout games are renowned for their post-apocalyptic and atompunk RPG elements, featuring a vast exploratory scale, eccentric factions, gratuitous violence, and offbeat humor.This series encapsulates all those aspects while managing to strike a balance by infusing a grounded dramatic tone that intertwines the excesses within a Western-style narrative structure, typical of modern series. It seamlessly integrates the main quest with character development, glimpses into the pre-nuclear world, and compelling sequences set within the Vault.Contrary to my initial concerns, the series avoids being overly absurd, showcasing well-thought-out design elements. The dialogue feels authentic, the storyline, albeit eccentric, aligns with the universe's essence, and the actors deliver performances that lend credibility to the narrative.Walton Goggins shines as Ghoul, Kyle MacLachlan impresses with his portrayal, and the entire cast delivers commendable performances. The chemistry between Lucy and Maximus is particularly noteworthy.It seems like Bethesda's Todd Howard has reason to celebrate, as this series is poised for success and may even boost sales of the original Fallout games. Following the success of ""The Last of Us,"" this adaptation further solidifies TV as a platform to expand upon vast gaming worlds.I am optimistic about the continuation of this trend and wholeheartedly recommend this series to fans of the genre and anyone who appreciates sci-fi and fantasy subgenres. ""Fallout"" the series earns a solid 8 out of 10 in my rating.",8
Amazing just amazing,"I've played my fair share of fallout games but not enough to be an expert in them. I mainly play them for the enjoyment of an apocalyptic style game.The way this show incorporates not only parts of the game but also the feeling of the game was outstanding. I loved all the twists and turns and head scratching scenarios it portrayed. The story telling was super easy to follow and pretty engaging, I never found myself wandering off and getting bored. I loved the diversity in the scenes as well. There's plenty of apocalyptic war scenes, as to be expended, but there's plenty of funny and engaging scenes to dissect.All in all this was an amazing cross between a show and the game coming to real life. So excited for season 2, hoping it comes with a bang!",10
Best game adaption ever,"By far the best work of prime.I'm very critical in how I invest my time and never write reviews but sometimes it's so worth it, that you take some extra time for it.First they created and even improved the vibe of the game.Excellent episodes, storytelling, casting, filming, CGI,...
Good feel about the pace of the episodes, not 1 bad episode in it, it was constant evolving, creating depth, improving to the story. It is just a must watch for everyone who loves the game but not necessary a must that you need to have played it OR everyone who enjoys a real masterpiece of a serie!Can't wait for season 2!This is the reason people switch from Netflix, Disney + to Prime.Took some balls of steel to take this on and they've done it excellent!Congrats to everyone involved with the show!",10
Excellent game to movie conversion.,"This is how video games should be translated onto the movie screen. Great stories, lots of great likeable characters,standing out are Ella punell and Walton Coggins that are excellent in their respective parts,I thinks it's only Aaron Clifton Moten as Maximus that lets the side down in my opinion, he's just miserable boring and an odd choice for the character, not sure why he was cast with such a vast array of actors available . Fallout gives you exactly the same post apocalyptic wasteland vibe that you get from the game, which is exactly what I was hoping for and is a favourite of mine. I can't wait for season 2.👍",9
THIS IS A VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION,"Whether you are a fan of the games or know nothing about them, Fallout does an amazing job satisfying both types of viewers.The creators of the series made the brilliant decision to create a new story in the Fallout universe that can coexist with all the games. Director, writer and producer Jonathan Nolan made it clear that he didn't want to drastically change any of the established lore but instead contribute to it and he accomplishes that goal remarkably.We follow 3 main characters on their journeys across the remnants of Southern California in a retro-futuristic nuclear fallout. The switching of perspectives from across a 200 year period of time is done often but the transitions are seamless and warranted. All the characters connect with each other in ways that feel natural. Some of the story arcs are deceivingly complex while others are mysterious in nature which will have you wanting to start a new episode as soon the current one you're on ends.Even the side stories involving supporting characters were compelling and led to some of the best moment in the entire season.The action, humor and drama in the series is evenly placed.Prime Video spared no expense when it came to the costume design, graphics and post apocalyptic alternate history setting.Fallout proves you can tell an original story without changing the core of the material to attract new viewership. In sticking with this idea, Prime Video set a new standard for future video game adaptions to follow.",9
Amazing Adaption to the game!,"I very rarely write a review for a show. I'll usually just like it and move on. This show is probably one of the best adaptations to a game universe that I have ever seen. Its an original story set in the world of the beloved game universe, so you don't need to play any of the games to enjoy it, but you are rewarded with so many wonderful homages if you have played.The little details go a long way, but the story itself is just beautifully done. It embellishes the Fallout universe with these strong characters, great arcs and fun dialogue throughout the whole season.Anyone trying to make an adaptation of a video game, should look to this show or TLOU as a blueprint. They take everything you love and just elevate it and make it special. I can't wait to see what else they include in season 2 and where the story goes! Do yourself a favor and watch this!",10
Dumb Fun But Not Deep,"I've never played a Fallout game, but I liked all of the little gadgets and sci-fi elements showcased in the show. I like the power armor, the ghouls, the bottle cap currency, the vaults, Pop-Boys, and et cetera. I also enjoyed the characters and every performance was stellar. I also appreciated the interesting casting choices, seeing Moises Arias play such a big part of the show was fun.However, a lot of the plotting is extremely convenient and clunky. Despite having to walk everywhere, characters will just run into each other by complete happenstance. This made the wasteland feel really small as characters could travel great distances with looking at all tired.The discussion of the themes was also extremely shallow and done a million times before. We've seen the Big Company Bad story a million times, and this show doesn't really add much new. Mr. Robot and The Boys are shows that have a much better critique of large conglomerates and capitalism.The filmmaking behind the show wasn't amazing, the Wasteland always looked really fake and the fight scenes were passable at best. Any scene in the Vault looked amazing, but once you get outside the Vault everything looked like a set.The finale also lacked any sense of great pay off as all the characters already knew each other and there wasn't a great sense of buildup to the climax.I didn't regret my time watching Fallout, it was a fun show to pass the time with, and I'll watch season 2, but it didn't blow my mind like it did for some other people.",6
A Captivating Adventure That Honors Its Roots and Explores New Depths,"The ""Fallout"" TV series does a fantastic job expanding on the beloved video game, keeping true to its essence while introducing fresh elements. The creators have managed to add new layers to the story without losing the core that fans love.Character development is a standout, especially the main character's evolution as she faces new challenges while holding onto her core beliefs. Another intriguing subplot features a character who undergoes a significant transformation after taking a new medicine.The series balances an adventurous tone with a mix of humor and darker moments. One of the most memorable scenes is the reveal of the skeletons from the main character's father's past, adding a surprising and emotional depth.Overall, ""Fallout"" is an engaging and well-crafted series that will captivate both longtime fans of the game and newcomers. It's an adventure worth watching from start to finish.",10
Should have stayed in the vault?,"This latest in a recent trend of videogame adaptations is lacking the edge and wit of the Fallout titles.Bethesda's famous IP could work on the small screen; but the ""how"" is something I feel is still, as of yet, unanswered. Porting a videogame to a TV show takes work because those are two very different mediums with different aims. Splitting the story between three characters isn't necessarily a bad idea (GoT did brilliantly on multiple subplots) but it can be hard to properly pull off. The sprightly Ella Purnell as the vault-dweller female protagonist Lucy MacLean has a face that fits the brand and a geniality and greenness to match, but is just missing something.The through-line and recycled ""brand"" is shaky, and I feel the show is unsure of its desired identity (at the moment). Original Fallout is hilariously unhinged, comical, with dark humour that simply flows between scenarios - across the different factions it challenges notions of conventional ethics and philosophies too, so there's always food for thought. But the challenge for the writers here is to find a story that can work cohesively on TV that feels like Fallout but takes it in the new direction of a plot-driven live action production.The dialogue in the games is outstanding and engaging, but here it's merely okay. Every word should entertain, develop, or expand. But I can't say that here it really does. We get a lot of camera panning into facial expressions and filler speech; but not enough meat and potatoes.The story lacks suitable structure. It feels too ""sandbox"" without enough linearity and purposeful direction. Where's the show going? What does the viewer have to look forward to? Where are the cliffhangers? On many occasions the show is absorbed in the scene of the moment and forgets about introducing the next chapter, the fluidity is missing. Where are the characters' driving motivations? Are the characters investable... or just expendable? The producers perhaps assume that the strength of the Fallout brand can compensate for mediocre writing. It doesn't.",6
"Visuals are great, everything else is terrible","I've been seeing a lot of reviews saying that fans of the game wouldn't like it but others would, and I have to completely disagree.I am not very familiar with the game but thought I'd give it a go. However, the acting is so stereotypically bad that I can't figure out if it's on purpose or not. I don't connect to any of them, they're stiff and robotic, and somehow overacting and under acting at the same time.One of the characters is off to find her dad, but I can't say I care. There's just no connection between the viewer and the characters. It's very 2 dimensional.Not sure if it gets better as the season progresses, but I fell asleep watching episode 2 (which is surprising since I never fall asleep watching tv), and took it as a sign to save myself from the rest of the season.",3
"A Wasteland Worth Exploring, With a Few Rad Bugs","Fallout, the highly anticipated television adaptation of the beloved video game franchise, landed on Amazon Prime in April 2024. Set in a post-nuclear Los Angeles, the series follows a new generation of vault dwellers venturing out into the irradiated wasteland. Here's a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses:The series captures the desolate beauty of the Fallout universe perfectly. The ruined Los Angeles skyline, the dusty settlements, and the irradiated creatures are all brought to life with impressive CGI and set design. Fallout's signature dark humor translates well to the screen. The witty dialogue and quirky characters provide much-needed levity amidst the grim backdrop. Ella Purnell shines as the resourceful vault dweller, while Aaron Moten brings gravitas to her conflicted companion. The supporting cast, including a charmingly ruthless Walton Goggins, adds layers of intrigue. The series doesn't shy away from exploring the consequences of war, corporate greed, and societal collapse. It offers a nuanced look at the struggle to rebuild in a broken world.The initial episodes are slow-burn, which might frustrate viewers looking for immediate action. The narrative picks up later in the season, but some might find it loses momentum towards the finale. While the series establishes the core themes of the Fallout universe, it doesn't delve as deeply into the lore as fans might expect. Some iconic locations and factions are missing, leaving some wanting more.The special effects, as mentioned earlier, are top-notch. The creature design is particularly impressive, bringing the mutated horrors of the wasteland to life in all their grotesque glory. The score effectively complements the atmosphere, with a blend of haunting melodies and suspenseful orchestrations.The entire cast delivers strong performances. Purnell embodies the determination and resilience of her character, while Moten brings depth to the morally ambiguous companion. Walton Goggins steals the show in his charismatic yet menacing portrayal of The GHOUL.Fallout is a solid debut season that captures the essence of the franchise. While the pacing and world-building could be improved, the series boasts stunning visuals, compelling characters, and thought-provoking themes. Fans of the games will find a lot to enjoy, and newcomers might be drawn into this unique post-apocalyptic world.It's worth checking out, but be prepared for a slow burn with a strong payoff in the later episodes.",8
"Great fun, even if I choose to be critical.","As what I can assume is the average Fallout fan who enjoys being critical (But fair) of shows/movies watching with a friend who barely knows Fallout, we thoroughly enjoyed every episode, almost in one sitting.I do enjoy being critical of media sometimes, but every time I felt a small frown across my face it was only after many minutes of awe, fear, or joy, which quickly resumed afterward. On occasion, do some characters act in a way that allows the scene to play out? Or have plot armour? Of course they do, it's a show where a story plays out, but that story was very good, and the actions taken/occuring never stood out to me as being ruinous or destructive of my viewing experience.The visual creations and changes from the base game(s) (Mostly Fallout 4 of course) were all great, I loved the armour, the power armour, there were only 2 scenes out of the whole first season (Please Season 2, please) that I thought it looked like cosplay foam. The scenery was great, even if most of it was dry ruins and cities, it made the world feel like pockets of people and chaos aurrpunded by inhospitable waste, which it's supposed to be. The underhand holding of the (In my opinion) kind of ugly Fallout 4 assault rifle made it feel bulkier and like a big menace which made it really cool. The new design of the 10mm Pistol is my favojrite so far, keeping some of the intended bulkiness but making it more sleek (Seriously though why does it have a revolving part, it holds like 10+ rounds, what's spinning and why?) But all of this, even if it sounds bad it small criticism in an overall amazing world, I will forever rant about small things, but this show was a blast and I can laugh along with it, not at it, it was amazing, with the inevitable tiny drawbacks, that did not disuade my 9/10 rating.",9
"Great watching, yet familiar story?","I'm probably in the minority of viewers that have never played the computer game franchise, so I come to this fresh.Hugely enjoyable and superb production, cast, crew,...10/10...yet...it feels familiar.Dark and mysterious stranger with back-story to match. Young innocents discovering the world, overcoming lethal problems deceptively easily. Everything building to staged showdown....It bears more than a passing resemblance to that other giant of dystopian TV from a few years back: Westworld. Maybe it's the sandy West. Perhaps it's the cowboy in black. Maybe its the acting style...This is not a criticism, yet it feels too close to be a genuine gem. Saying that, I'll still eagerly Google when series 2 is airing; filling the time by rewatching Westworld.",8
Lives Up to the Hype. Probably the Best Video Game Adaptation I've Ever Seen.,"I haven't played Fallout, but I'm fairly familiar with the lore, and my brother is a HUGE fan, so I've absorbed some of it. To me, Fallout feels like a special franchise with a lot of cool ideas.. I went into Fallout expecting the worst given that it's a 2020s era adaptation AND a streaming show (this time, on Amazon Prime).I'm happy to say this thing really won me over. It took an episode or two, but man, I left this first season of Fallout feeling like this was quite possibly the best video game adaptation ever made. It actually makes me optimistic for the future of adaptation; if more movies and shows could do what Fallout did, I don't think audiences would be (as) miffed. But I'm getting ahead of myself.Fallout is so good that it almost seems effortless. Not only is the world building absolutely excellent, with the show drip feeding information at a perfect pace, but it LOOKS awesome too. Multiple times while watching this I jokingly said, ""this place would be perfect for the Amazonworld theme park that's inevitably in the works."" That's how good so many of these sets were.The show is excellently paced; it doesn't feel like it's dragging its feet and while it's fairly obvious what the final episode will entail, Fallout manages to keep things fresh and exciting, going in directions I didn't expect. There's about four major storylines and they all intersect from time to time, in a logical and fun way that I felt was a masterclass in storytelling.It also nailed its tone and never wavered from it, even when it got more intense and dramatic towards the end. It's overall a very funny show that doesn't take itself too seriously, but when it does, it really hits. I think it deftly manages comedy, horror, drama, and suspense really, really well and kept me engaged the entire time.The characters are also great here, buoyed by some really great performances. Walter Goggins as The Ghoul is undoubtedly the show stopper of the season. He manages to be intimidating, but not comically, and a cold, brutal man who still want to see succeed. I love how by the end of the season, he's not changed all that much, but the context about him has and that makes you, the audience, see him in a new light.Ella Purnell is also FANTASTIC as Lucy. I'd only seen her in Zach Snyder's Army of the Dead in a truly hilarious role, so I didn't have high expectations. But she's such a perfect and effective protagonist, with her naivety leading to some of the show's best moments. She grows a lot through the course of the show, yet, similar to The Ghoul, still retains what makes her the character we came to love. I also really liked Aaron Moten as Maximus; he has a nervous energy that I felt worked very well. He can be competent and capable, but not so much so where it feels alienating. He really is the closest to a ""normal"" person we meet the entire show, which might not be the highest praise, but I was always rooting for him.There are just so many great choices in this series. I love how each of the three protagonists represents something about humanity: Moten's Maximus the well meaning everyman who, like most of us, will do bad things if it means survival. The Ghoul represents humanity lost, and the result when pure self-interest and cynicism take over. And Lucy idealism and civility; tested, of course, but still there at the end of the day.Then there's the litany of fantastic side characters and bit roles; the amazing 50s aesthetic and music, the compelling mystery and oh, I didn't even mention Moises Arias and his excellent arc and character, Norm. (After the first episode, I kinda hoped that was the last we'd seen of the vaults, but man, they were some of the best stuff from this season) The whole mini story in Vault 4 was phenomenal; it's was a masterclass in foreshadowing and exploring theme, whilst giving us some hilarious moments and great relationship building for Lucy and Maximus.As for complaints, I do think some of the CG is a bit shody. I didn't love how the Knights of the Brothers of Steel looked and there some moments of rubbery, ugly CG that took me out of the show. I didn't love Maximus's storyline by itself, but I found it left A LOT of room for more in the future.Yeah, watch this thing. Just watch it. It's excellent. It won me over, and it makes me want to play the games. What higher praise for a video game adaptation is there?",9
Clinic on producing existing intellectual property,"Considering all the terrible producers in 2024 - who regularly crush the dreams of Star Trek, Star Wars and fans of other established intellectual properties, very refreshing to see an IP with tons of merit getting produced by individuals who understand their job.Fallout is a Legendary video game franchise. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are, to me, top 10 all time video games. Fallout three was like GTA III - it changed the industry. Gamers were provided interactive bliss for a game that one could sink 100+ hours into, which is remarkable for a single player experience. Fallout and Fallout 2 were more turn based strategy games, but established a ton of lore, items and ideas that were carried forward into Fallout 3 - a third person action game. But a third person action game with Role Playing Game and Strategy Game elements also incorporated into design. Gamers were given a ton of customization for building their character, both aesthetically and how they applied 'perk' abilities while leveling. The beauty of Fallout 3 is how the player could really tailor a character's ability to exactly what they want. This included physical abilities, improved use of tools and weapons, intelligence abilities like hacking, and charisma abilities for better communication and deception. On a single play through, not all abilities could be had - so the player had to pick and choose abilities to round out their character.That's all a lot - but the bottom line is there are great games in the Fallout franchise, and a ton of merit from which to draw from. For the record, I would say the same thing about the Monster Hunter franchise, and the MH movie was a god awful train wreck. That is where intelligent production comes in. You need producers who understand what it takes to make good television, but also who understand the source IP, and know how to draw merit out of that IP. In the modern era, it seems like many producers think that they can just take an existing IP and do whatever the heck they want with it: change fundamentals, insert outside content that has nothing to do with original IP, and worst yet - use the existing IP to float their own messaging and insipid ideas.Not in Fallout! In Fallout the producers hired the right people, and let them work. I wonder if they ever had to define parameters, or if the producers were able to simply get out of the way, and let their chosen talent do their jobs. However it unfolded, the end result is a borderline masterpiece.Fallout the TV show is about a future world that never grew out of the 1950s style and aesthetic. The mix of retro aesthetic, science fiction future and post apocalyptic wasteland makes for a great playground to inject characters and narrative. Which is exactly what happens. While Fallout does have a single main character, there are basically three main characters, each with their own story arc. These arcs intersect, which unfolds across 8 AAA episodes. A second season has already been authorized.While the show unfolds in an easily digested manner - the story is quite complex, as is the backstory for each character. While I'm sure many have attempted a summery? I just recommend watching the show. One episode will probably be enough to fully commit, but if there is any doubt, definitely watch at least three complete episodes, kinda like an anime, before deciding what the show is. Fallout has a lot of highly stylized violence, often with humor involved. The effects and really all technical qualities are top notch. This is one of the better seasons of TV, all genres, in the last 10 years. Its up there with the best of GoT, early seasons.If you can't tell, I loved this first season of Fallout. It also gets me going on my ax grind - producers who selfishly attempt to ruin existing intellectual properties for dubious reasons. But I know it's not as simple as understanding and loving a video game to make it into good TV. Producers also have to understand their own medium, and how to pick and choose merit from the other genre to make something good.But this is great! Such a Rare gem! And - gamers know that Bethesda, the company behind Fallout, has been struggling for the last 5+ years with their video game releases. Their last great game was Fallout 4, but even it fell short of Fallout 3 and NV in my opinion. Fallout 4 came out over 8 years ago! That is a Long time with no great releases. It is my hope that the Fallout TV show reaches a mass media audience, and provides the influx of resources and interest that Bethesda needs to make more great video games in the future. Even if that doesn't happen, if this show is done right for multiple seasons - it could be the greatest thing to come from that publisher. And that, to me, is an astonishing possibility.",9
What an amazing story can't wait to watch it a second time,"First of all the acting in this show is absolutely unbelievable. I've always been a big fan of Walter Goggins in more than one show, and he absolutely is great in this one. Ella Pernell doesn't absolutely amazing role. Her attitude and performance is amazing. I will admit that I only played the video game briefly. But I can't wait to download the game again and play it. It is wonderful to see a really great story brought to life in such vivid detail. Can't wait for the next season.I would describe the season as a little bit of a slow burn. They are developing the key characters. This tells me that there is a long ark to the story. I wish that it was 10 years in the future and I could watch all the episodes at once.",10
Horrible,"This show actually thinks its viewers are a bunch of unintelligent feral ghouls (which I am starting to think is the case based on the number of high ratings); every single element of the show is in some way made with the thought ""How should the audience feel about this moment?"" -- and of course this is not an issue in itself -- however, they are taking the absolute shortest path in this regard every damn time. Something happens that should be terrifying (according to the producers)? TERRIFYING MUSIC PLAYING. The ghoul guy ""acts cool""? HIGH PITCHED OMINOUS YODELLING PLAYING. This is an irk that will stay with me forever, and some people might think this is stupid. And yeah, in many cases music is good at carrying an emotion through, since it is an audio-visual medium we are talking about. But when listening to the soundtrack with some thought it becomes apparent what is happening; the music is changing at least once every thirty seconds to accommodate whatever is happening, and it gets tiring real fast.Next on the list, the god-awful ""innocent""-humour that the vault woman is doing in every encounter. Yeah, it was not funny the first time.Closely related, the one-dimensionality of characters: the show is basically just a bunch of exposition with nothing really happening. Everything is either one same dry joke, something ""cool"" happening (stupid action scene with a minigun shooting a guy at point blank and not hitting once -- seriously wtf was that?) or supposedly-sad (but not actually, since no actual attachment is being formed with the characters because who would get attached to somebody as emotionally thin as butter on your bread.",
I'm torn,"I started off really not liking this show. The first two episodes are a mighty let down with a lot of bad writing and plot conveniences. Characters just know things. She has been locked in a bunker all her life, but she knows what a raider is? That she would just run into the man she needs to to find the raider that took her father. Twice. Which led me to my biggest complaint, there is no adventure in this adventure story. Nothing has any real significance, they are just places. There is no destination for most of the series, its just a vague direction that eventually comes together because the season needs to come to an end. Nothing is earned, nobody has any significance and its just a stop on a trip to nowhere. But then episode three starts and the series makes a complete 180. The lack of any real focus is still there, but now we are blessed with the story of the series' best character, The Ghoul.Cooper Howard is a great character with an interesting backstory, commanding presence, and a well needed kick in the show's pants. And he works well paired with Lucy Maclean, hardening her and preparing her for the dangers of the wasteland. And this carries over when she later leaves him for Maximus, helping her cover for the weakest of the three main characters. Maximus is just awful, a sniveling jerk at worst and a overgrown child at best. And we also have another surprisingly interesting plot arises, Norm Maclean who I thought was going to be a weasel character easily written off, steps up in his investigation behind the vault's new overseer. For four episodes this series really had me invested.And then it tried to wrap up the stories, to an underwhelming conclusion. The overseer's secret should have been a bigger impact but was undercut by the revelations in The Ghoul's story. Revelations that were a massive overstretch, namely that corporations have any nukes let alone enough to initiate nuclear Armageddon. And that they still have nukes to destroy the socialist utopia of a woman who somehow aged thirty years in the last 200.For four episodes, I thought the show was really interesting and for four episodes I was sorely disappointed. I liked the look of the locations but never once were any of them memorable to the plot. I liked three of the four main characters and wanted to see where they ended up but was left underwhelmed in the end. I liked the throwbacks the the games but the new content doesn't live up to them as much. Every step forward also felt like a step back.",6
A Fallout gamer's view.,"When this first dropped a trailer, i was initially angry, at the fact it was set on the west coast where three of the games take place (1, 2, NV).As more went on, I started to tolerate it, but ultimately waited to watch this to formulate my opinion.Before I summarize each episode from my point of view, The props, scenery, and costumes are done to perfection. Everything made me feel like I was watching the games I love come to life.Anyways, onto my opinon.Episode 1 was an absolutely masterpiece. It portraits vault life down to the last detail, even what life is like within a BoS military camp. It sets the protagonist's goal, their motive, and their opportunity excellently. Not to mention the scene at the start, which is so tense if you know what's going to happen. When it does, it take everything away with a bang (Pun intentional.)Episode 2 picks it up nicely, introducing us to the series most loved canine companion, dogmeat, and also giving us a brief look at the Enclave. The scenery and atmosphere drives people into what the post war world was like, and Lucy's vain vision of trying to rebuild america gets shut down by every settler above ground.Episode 3. Vault life is pure evil, a dystopia nuclear family vision instilled into these dwellers shows on full display (Props to Norm for being smart.) It also introduces us to one of the many mutated creatures, some salamander, which I believe should have been some geckos, or deathclaws, to better suit it's environment.Episode 4. Feral ghouls and My Handys are done exceptionally well. When Lucy emerges from the super duper mart, it's a perfect time for her to break into the wasteland life. It's common for us all to do it in the games on our first run, we try our best to be nice, but ultimately end up death machines... but Lucy doesn't. This episode was the first one where my hope for the series being faithful starts to waver.Episode 5. I started to get angry at this point, because of two things. One is Lucy's vain hope for a nuclear life, which she tries over and over, but it just keeps getting shut down at every turn. The other... now my real nit picking arose at the sight of Shady sands being destroyed. Gamers knew from 1, 2, and NV, that Shady sands is the heart of the NCR, and that it's the main support line for the troops in the mojave fighting the legion... IN 2281, FOUR YEARS AFTER IT WAS MEANT TO BE NUKED. Todd howard addressed this by saying NV was canon and considered for this series, but how can you say that when something like this happened?Episode 6. Vault 4 is cool, it's experiment was clear, and all the lore was there for us to experience. Yes, the cult gathering where everyone stripped naked to honour Shady sands and their 'Raider god'. I also love any time it takes us back to pre war america (Except episode 8), the story is so gripping and actually made me plead for a whole episode pre war, maybe during operation anchorage.Episode 7. NCR riot gear on full display, the only time we see it, at all, the only presence bar the flag... and then nothing. Maximus shutting down the vault just for power armour was nice. A voodoo wizard turning someone into a ghoul via a serum??? NOW HOLD UP. The ghoulification process is one that requires a high dose of radiation, like with the ghoul, and plenty of characters in the main games... so an injection can do it now??? The love story is horrid as well, a cheap cop out to entice plot armour.Episode 8. Now this... this was my ultimate hatred coming out. Let's start before the great war, and it's all in one scene. Vault tec talking with Robco, General Atomic, Repconn, and the Big MT. It all seemed a cheap shot to really drill home that vault tec was pure evil, but we didnt need that. No gamer every got told that Vault tec were evil, nor that they dropped the bombs. We had to find that information with no aid from bethesda or obsidian. I believe they only had this conference to have the old phrase 'War never changes', which could have been done in so many better ways. Maximus, now back in Filly which has become a BoS camp, somehow manages to be spared, and then is told by the elder that they can rebuild the brotherhood? Never would a BoS elder conspire with a squire to rebuild it, they would have exiled him on the spot for poor performance in the field. Not like it matters as Maximus gets a promotion to knight at the end, so that whole piece could have just been made different.Lucy, upon reaching the LA observatory, the last bastion of the NCR in the boneyard (The LA area in Fallout 1, and the correct name for this area), meets Moldaver... and this piece is so good, the acting is excellent, that she explains to her with no persuasion, nor word of a lie, that Hank is the one to nuke shady sands. The delivery is amazing, but the fact an overseer of V33 has access to nuclear armaments just takes the biscuit. At what point could Vault tec had predicted that their overseers would want to nuke cities out of pure spite and revenge? Oh, let's not forget, that they teased season 2 by a shot of New Vegas. This means there is now a canon timeline for the second battle of Hoover dam, and this put's the bar incredibly high from the gaming community that Bethesda do this correctly.Ultimately, I wish it had been done somewhere else, like Chicago, Atlanta, or even the state of Texas. By doing it in California, they limit themselves because of the expectations that have already been set in the games.",8
"Faithful to the games, but....","I've played Fallout 3, NV and 4 and I was very impressed by how faithful the show was to the games.The look of the vaults, the weapons, the environment, etc..But the main aim of the whole show, seemed to me, was to say to gamers - ""Hey, look at this, just like the games, aren't we clever!"", without fleshing out the plot enough.Also, I found some of the actors a bit underwhelming, or miscast, one in particular.On the other side, I thought Moises Arias was great in his role.The last episode though, with the 'reveal' was quite good, and did bump up my rating.Couple of other detractions:-
one CGI monster was not convincing.it was not explained how one character managed to survive from prior to the bombs to the shows timeline. But maybe I missed the explanation?Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the series and will watch the next season. The show was certainly better than the majority of other game to show productions I've seen.",7
Aesthetically nice but terribly written,"What had to be expected from Bethesda. As a long time fan of 1 and 2 I was already well aware Bethesda never understood Fallout. Fallout isn't about some 1950s retro future, that world got nuked and is gone! All that remains of that time are uncanny relics of the past. Bethesda Fallout looks and feels like the bombs fell 20 years ago and we're bearly making a comeback, not 200 years later.Also the ""Ghouls are Zombies"" thing is a hill Bethesda is apparently willing to die on.Costumes and settings look quite nice, the female lead is convincing. Turning the whole message to ""capitalism bad"" is laughable coming from Amazon. Also way too light hearted. Has vibes of Suicide Squad but without being funny. Also retcons a lot of Fallout 1,2 and New Vegas. Mediocre show at best.",5
Kept Hoping For Mutants!,"This was everything I was hoping for and more with the only exception being the lack of the ever present mutants that were prominent in the video games. I might have my releases confused so if they didn't exist in the releases the series is based on, apologies. The mutants presented a consistent and ever present danger as one of the strongest and most feared villains in the game. Additionally, they always had significant loot and imaginative and deadly weaponry in their hives. I'm hoping to see them introduced in future episodes. I realize the makeup and special effects budget would skyrocket with their introduction, but now that we see that the series will succeed, please, bring them on!!!",9
"Not perfect, but very solid all around","I actually came in expecting this show to be bad. Honestly, most the trailers I saw looked cringe and poorly put together. Thankfully, those trailers captured a few lesser moments but it didnt hurt the overally quality of the show.Yes, Lucy can be a bit annoying at times but after a few episodes her character continued to develop and she settled into the role. We also follow Maximus, the Ghoul and Norm. I was interested in each of the side stories that tied everything together.This is a great and rare example of how a show doesn't have to perfectly follow the games but can still be very good when you strike a good balance between characters, lore and storytelling while still tapping into the things that made it special in the first place. Something the recent Halo show failed miserably at.They also earn extra points by including dogs as an integral part of the story. After all, it was the thought of dogs being left out of the vaults that pushed Cooper(the ghoul) over the edge and into discovering what Val-tec was really about.This is a really fun, gory, dark but enjoyable ride. Looking forward to the next season for sure.",8
Entertaining,"I haven't played Fallout, so I can't compare to the game, but this was immensely enjoyable as an adapted video game. It felt like a perfect balance between a stand-alone series and gameplay-- there were times that I could really feel the video game vibe in the exploration of a new space or on a mission to retrieve an object, but it was so well integrated that it enhanced the viewing experience, rather than detracting from it.The humor was unexpectedly good, and I loved the juxtaposition of the mid-century modern aesthetic and music with the dystopian landscape and technology. They combined to give a sort of zany, modernized steampunk feel, similar to Legion, but less serious.Walton Goggins was exceptional, as always. He really elevated his role, and Ella Purnell was a delight. I thought the Maximus storyline was rather weak, but I don't know if that was from the acting or writing. The only other quibble was the lack of true peril; I never really felt like our heroes were ever truly in jeopardy.Very much looking forward to more!",9
One of the best video game adaptations ever,"I wasn't keeping an eye on this at all. I love Fallout but when I heard it was getting an adaptation from everyone's favorite evil corporation, I wasn't really filled with confidence. On top of that, Fallout 4 was more middling than I'd hoped and 76 was...76, so Fallout was sort of in a weird place for me. All this to say that I only really only had a passing interest.Well I was wrong, this show absolutely nailed it. It blew my expectations out of the water and shot up to being possibly my favorite video game adaptation ever. A shining example, just like the Last of Us series, of what this kind of story can do. The screentime and overall stories of each of the protagonists is balanced and written so well, and they all end up being characters I want to see more of.Quite possibly one of the most impressive things is how much the show really FEELS like it is the plot of a Fallout game, in a good way. You can see the different character builds, the main questline, the sidequest, the factions, the gear and set design. And there is a DOG. Everything is crafted with real appreciation for the source material and, as a bonus, tells a completely new story instead of adapting an existing plot.The only real thing I think it was missing was more unique creatures and locales. I'm looking forward to seeing where this show goes from here.",9
Amazing show but could be better,"First of all, i am an fallout game fan, I've played Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4.So I would dare to call myself a long time fan.Because of the history of adaptations i was holding back on watching this, until i watched the first episode and was like wauw, and then watched the second and again wauw and so on and so on.. and finally done.. what a great show. I would have given this a 9 out of 10 if it wasn't for the character maximus.What a bad character, what is his qualities? Why is he bad at everything, why is he a douche, what is with his facial expressions. I could go on, show would be almost perfect without him.At the end of the season i hoped so much he would die maybe even sacrifice himself i don't know.. boy was a disappointed when he lived.But if I look at the whole show, this is amazing.. the sets, the feel, the characters, the reference to one of my favorite games.. well done 👏
I am very pleased, I can't wait for the next season.I just hope they kill maximus next season. 😅",8
Longtime fan happy to see the series embodied on television.,"This show was the absolute pinnacle of entertainment when it comes to portraying the beloved game series in the form of entertainment. I loved every second of it, and believe that despite the harsh ratings, there is some form of excess criticism from other fans.There are to a degree, some plot holes/pieces of lore that are restructured in the show. This however, does create a future dynamic that can be molded upon and tied into with the games. I am extremely excited to see how this functions with the upcoming AAA title.In addition to this, I am certain that even for first time enjoyers of the series, the series creates an undeniably captivating storyline, and sets up for an amazing second season.While I am not spoiling the show, this is sure to be a continued success provided the same quality & craftsmanship that went into the first season carries into the next.",10
"Nailed the aesthetic, wouldn't have worked without it.","Looks great, is sometimes funny, stays true to the source material, but feels incredibly shallow and drawn out. If the season had 30 episodes I might have been able to overlook that nothing's really happened to the story after the seventh episode, but this season's just a prologue.Unlike with Arcane or LOU, the two better game adaptations I've seen, the focus here is on the look, and on fan service for the gamers, not on a compelling story.The world is also impossible to understand for those who haven't played the games. What's a ghoul? How do you become one? Why's that person alive? Why isn't that one? How does the tech work? How long has it been since.. yeah you get it, a million questions most of us who've played the games can answer, but struggle explaining to those next to us stepping into the world for the first time.Hoping for a more story driven season 2!",7
Slow at the beginning but turns out awesome by the end,"I was definitely not convinced at the beginning. Even hated episode one but sticked with it although I couldn't watch more than 1 episode a day. Found the mood very overpowering. However by the last episodes I was hooked and when everything came together I realized it's a great show. The story is awesome, the filming and aesthetics is excellently done. Now I have never heard of the game because I'm not into that but the series I found just great. Can't help it but be excited about season 2 to discover how this story unravels. I recommend it. Slow in the beginning but turns out awesome by the end. Objectively speaking an excellent show.",9
Entertaining and worth the watch but....,"I watched every episode and found them all to be entertaining yet average on most levels.....with the delightful exception of ""The Ghoul"". There is no way all these 10/10 and 9/10 reviews are anything but hype/bait.Throughout the 8 episodes I constantly had the feeling that something just wasn't quite working on various levels.....almost like the production had been rushed.The series is not terrible by any means, just not as good as I'd hoped. Maybe my expectations were just too high but two things are for certain, some of the acting is not up to par and some casting is just plain wrong.....Watch the series and I'm sure you'll realize these weaknesses early on just as I did. There were a few other things that bothered me but thinking maybe it was just me so I won't mention them.There is a bit of gory content but what else would you expect when ghouls are involved.I do recommend the Fallout series because all in all it is entertaining and worth the watch....just had so much potential to be even better.",6
Hard to find a character to like,"I want to start by saying I never played the video game series, but my brother has. I have been watching with him and getting his input. It does incorporate the theme and details, with some characters from the game. Which is great that it is not like the Halo series, as they did whatever they wanted to do without following the classic story.However, I quit watching after 5 episodes because I cannot find a good, grounded character that is not extremely strange and relatable. Lucy is the closest to a relatable character with hope, but she is so arrogant and obtuse. I understand this is a post-apocalyptic series but I love The Last of Us, which followed characters in a crappy situation as well. The Protagonists in Fallout are just bad people, making you question rooting and hoping they will change for the greater good. Also, so many plot holes, I don't mean to be nit-picky, but for example why the heck would they not check for radiation before the wedding, why would the robot give Lucy a finger to then harvest her organs, and the raiders running away after max crushes one of their heads while not in the suit. There are so many more I don't understand and they have no reasoning behind it.Another problem is why is everything so sexual. I did not have a problem with Lucy saying she had incest with her cousins because that could be unfortunately somewhat understandable in their situation. But why would you need to show a guy masturbating in the boot camp (that would not change the story or scene at all). Also, the pregnant woman in the vault with the cousin dressing as her husband, literally no need for these scenes, it's uncomfortable, and only pleases some weird fans fantasy of incest.The ghoul was the only good character written in the show, in my opinion. I was really disappointed, especially from all the hype. I am sorry if this offended any diehards of the series, I thought I would put this out there however.",3
A great spin on a Playstation classic,"The crossover from PS5 to TV is an all time high, having enjoyed movies Resident Evil & Super Mario Bros, Mortal Kombat was OK...We now have a new TV series spin off from the classic game and having played it the similarities and the terrain after the 'fallout' from the 1950s atomic bomb is just brilliant!The Goul played by 'Walton Goggins' was gold and totally stole the show, the cast were brilliant and loved 'The Brotherhood of Steel' suits were just epic!Plot had a few twists which was good and seeing the surface 100 years later was great, with giant bugs and a bear you would rather walk away from..... Love the exploding parts from Goul's impressive shotgun, remind me not to cross his path..Hoping for a season 2 to expand the story in to the wastelands, no spoilers!",8
"Watch out, don't lose your head.","Fallout does a great job capturing the unique tone that makes the games so great. An apocalyptic future suspended in time. That time being 1950's America. It's an ironic take on the Eisenhower period that takes the nuclear family a little too literally.It's entertaining to watch the contrast between humour and violence that resembles the Coen brothers' best work, whereby the humour is genuinely funny and the violence has real stakes.I was initially skeptical about this series. As a big fan of the games, it seemed like opportunistic studios just trying to capitalize on the ""video game to TV"" success of The Last of Us, but it's clear that between the big budget production, attention to detail and solid artistic choices (writing, acting and camera work all are exceptional), this is a passion project for Jonathon Nolan (brother of Christopher Nolan) and I think they've done a great job.Whether you're a fan of sci-fi, western, comedy, action/adventure, or just big, world building entertainment, this show has a bit of everything.",8
Long time Fallout Player Here.,"Overall a quick run down is that the show is great, they follow the lore, canon, culture, and feel of the Fallout universe well while connecting the necessary dots in between the stories of the game.Episode 1: They show the prewar world through the eyes of The Ghoul back when he was human with his daughter, he was a western star. At the birthday party the nukes start to drop and he escapes with his daughter via horseback. We meet our three protagonists Lucy of Vault 33, Maximus of the Brotherhood, and a sentient cowboy simply known as The Ghoul. We learn their varying backstories. Lucy Maclean is an optimistic but naive Vault Dweller and daughter of the Overseer Hank. She is married off to another vault dweller from a different vault as a trade but they don't realize it was raiders led by a woman named Lee Moldaver, it is hinted she has a secret past with Hank but that isn't established until episode 8. Moldaver kidnaps Hanks which makes Lucy leave the vault. Maximum is working as a brotherhood grunt cleaning up crap talking to his friend Dane before the Prydwen (a giant flying airship) arrives as they need squires (assistants) to help the knights (soldiers with power armor). For those that don't know the BoS is the Brotherhood of Steel, a military dedicated to protecting the people of the waste and harboring dangerous technology so others can't have it.Maximum and Dane talk recruitment and Dane ends up getting recruited but somebody sabotages Dane by putting a razor in his boot so they couldn't go. The perpetrator of this act would be revealed in episode 8 so Maximum replaces Dane as squire for a Knight named Titus.Minor characters Slim, Hancho, and Biggie go to a base in Mexico to free The Ghoul for a man named Don Pedro. They end up in a conflict where The Ghoul kills all three and ends the episode.This episode has 14 kills between biggie, hancho, slim, the vault dwellers, and the raiders using various firearms and melee weapons, junk jet, and even a barrel of pickles. I found references to Grognak, Corvega, Mister Handy, Pro Snap Camera, and the Junk Jet weapon in this episode.In episode 2 we meet an Enclave scientist named Wilzig and his dog companion he met in his lab called CX404 later referred to as Dogmeat. The Enclave are evil scientists and they just unlocked a powerful device that has the ability to restore power to long dead grids of land. He injects this is his own head, steals the dog, and escapes the Enclave. This is why Don Pedro freed the ghoul and also the reason the Brotherhood of Steel is after Wilzig. Lucy eventually meets the scientist as she wakes up and he tells her to return home seemingly knowing of her family, the vault, and more. She carries on regardless. Meanwhile Knight Titus and Squire Maximus are flying in a Vertibird (modified military helicopter) to a town called filly (not philadelphia).Wilzig eventually stumbles upon a cave hearing a roar he decides to leave. Maximus and Titus stumble across the same cave and Maximum eventually kills what turns out to be a Yao Guai (a bear with increased size and strength from radiation mutating their dna) who was chasing Titus. Titus talks mad s*** to Maximum so in turn Maximum lets Titus die and steals his power armor. Shortly after he saves a guy who turns out to be a lover of chickens.Lucy arrives at filly meeting with Ma June as Ma explains that the vault dwellers are hated by surfacers, WIlzig arrives. The ghoul arrives after and shoots Wilzig's leg off before fighting off the whole town as Ma offered them 1000 caps (currency is now bottlecaps) to kill the ghoul. Maximum arrives and fights The Ghoul one on one but using his military history The Ghoul exposes the weakness of the armor causing Maximum to fly off uncontrollably. Lucy and Wilzig escape with a cybernetic leg for Wilzig made by Ma June. He takes a cyanide pill as he isn't going to make it and reveals he was headed to Moldaver and tells Lucy to chop off his head and offer her the treasure inside for her father. She agrees and after he dies she chops off his head. The dog was shot in the midst of the fight but The Ghoul stimpaks him so he'll track him to Wilzig.This episode had roughly 11 kills mostly to the ghoul using three different kinds of firearms, but also one suicide, one bear attack bleed out, and my favorite was the guy who got the bullet to the neck that the ghoul talks to. There was references to Cram, stimpaks, bobbleheads,the ripper, railway rifle, assaultrons, turrets, and super mutants.Episode 3- We learn the ghouls name is Cooper Howard or Coop for short who was a Hollywood western star. Lucy with Wilzig's head sets off for Moldaver with Coop and Dogmeat tracking behind. Maximum fakes his own death to the BoS and pretends to be Knight Titus, they send him a new squire which turns out to be his old bully Thaddeus. Thaddeus not realizing its maximum as the armor disguises his voice and covers his features continues his ruse pretending to be Knight Titus. This allows Maximum to reciprocate the bullying he got.Back at the vault Chet (lucy's brother) and Jack (a guy who had a crush on Lucy and was guard of the vault door) get in trouble for Lucy's escape. This causes Jack to lose his job.Lucy encounters a Gulper (a giant mutated amphibian thing) that eats the head of Wilzig, shortly after Cooper meets Lucy and against her will uses her as bait to get the Gulper but this is unsuccessful. They eventually leave but Maximus and Thaddeus fight the gulper, killing it and retrieving the head. Coop takes Lucy hostage. The vault's water chip turns out to be destroyed in the raid attack so they only have 2 months of water left to live for the whole vault. The episode ends with a flashback of Cooper doing adds for Vault-Tec's vaults. There was references to sugar bombs, Vault-tec, and yum yum deviled eggs in this one as well as two scavs that got killed.Episode 4- Lucy and Cooper meet Roger who is Coopers friend who is turning Feral (this is a process where a sentient ghoul loses his mind and turns into a bestial zombie like creature). Cooper kills roger as he thinks of his mother's cooking, this upsets Lucy but Cooper lets her know this is the way of the wasteland, she ends up having to drink irradiated water to stay alive. They also cut eachother's fingers off in a skirmish, well one cut off , one bit off. Stephanie Harper who was Lucy's best friend is pregnant and depressed with her husband killed so she ends up having sex with Jack back at the vault as she pretends he is her dead husband.Coop sells Lucy to some organ harvesters working out of Super Duper Mart. She doesn't realize this until she is inside and they repaired her finger. Back at the vault Jack and Chet investigate vault 32 finding mutilated and strange corpses throughout, something bad happened but they don't know what yet. Back at the Super Duper Mart Lucy fights out of her binds and shocks the Mister Handy attempting to harvest. Lucy seeing ghoul prisoners frees them but the ferals and organ harvesters end up killing eachother and the old lady ghoul turns feral forcing lucy to kill her. This hurt her because unlike the raiders this was something that was innocent moments ago. She gets equipped with armor and guns finally learning the premise of the game and leaves Coop with the super duper mart where he was as much drugs and ghoul antidote (stops the progress of going feral) as he could want.There was 6 kills including the ferals, 7 if you count the Mister Handy.Episode 5- Maximus reveals that he let Titus die and stole his armor to Thaddeus who doesn't take this well. They get in a fight where Maximum crushes Thaddeus foot with the power armor turning it to near pulp but Thaddeus steals his fusion core to permanently trap Maximum in his armor like a steel prison. Radroaches begin swarming him and eating at the armor when Lucy saves Maximum and in turn he gives her some radaway (an IV drip that drains radiation) for her radiation sickness she got from drinking the dirty water in the last episode. There is a fight with two fiends (cannibalistic humans) on a bridge that leaves Maximus injured as they travel so they head for Hawthorne Labs. Back at the vault Betty is elected overseer to replace the missing Hank. Chet asks Stephanie about vault 31 but she is deliberately vague. Maximus and Lucy arrive at the wreckage of Shady Sands. Shady Sands was a town from the original Fallout game that the main character visited and would eventually help turn into the NCR (New California Republic) a military group trying to help the wastes. There was 5 kills including 3 radroaches and cannibals Rink and Javin.Episode 6-Two sheriffs kidnap cooper and bring him to their leader to start the episode. Lucy and Maximus head to vault 4 where a rotten tooth is removed from Maximus wound. They learn vault 4 is full of mutants and suspect it to be a cult. In a flashback it is revealed Cooper was in Operation Anchorage (it was the last major resource battle between China and the U. S. before the war). Lucy and the oversee talk as she learns history of Shady Sands and NCR. Cooper meets with Sorrel who is self proclaimed ""president of the government"". Rex and Troy interrogate Cooper but both Sheriffs are killed, Sorrel and Coop discuss Moldaver. Lucy discovers horrible acts in the forbidden section of Vault 4 where a woman births piranhas. Lucy gets caught and captured. There was 2 kills and references to West-Tech in this episode.Episode 7+8 Lucy and Maximus get kicked out of Vault 4 but learn vault tec is evil, the ghoul has a history with moldaver, Thaddeus gets foot healed but is turned into a ghoul, stephanie becomes overseer of 32, maximus rejoins BoS, in prewar coop spied on Vault tech through his wife betty who is overseer of 33, Lucy finds out her dad worked for vault tech, he escapes for Vegas. Awesome show but reached by character limit.",9
Fallout - How to adapt a video game,"I've read a lot of comments saying this is one of the best video game adaptations of all time. I don't know about that as I've never played the game but what I do know is that it's one of the best post apocalyptic series ever made!It's basically split into 3 stories which interconnect.There is Lucy, played by Ella Purnell, who lives in a community under the earth in one of 3 Vaults. No one has ventured outside since the world became a radioactive wasteland. But circumstances will dictate that Lucy will go outside in a quest to find her father.Then there is Maximus played by Aaron Moten, a servant assigned to look after a Knight called Titus. Knights are men who wear powerful suits of armour and are highly regarded and respected. Maximus has a dream of becoming one and that dream is eventually realised.Then last but by no means least there's The Ghoul, a mutant cowboy with a droll delivery and no nose. This character is destined to become iconic and Walton Goggins who plays him is faultless. He's funny, scary and ruthless in equal measure but has a great backstory which humanises him.The creation of the devastated world and creatures that inhabit it are beautifully rendered. It is visually stunning but the visuals are backed up by an excellent script and brilliant direction. The pace is just about perfect. The intertwining of the stories is expertly done.This is hugely entertaining and leaves you wanting more.",9
Amazon has finally found a brand that they have chemistry with and that they can adapt successfully.,"Apparently, the budget was generous. I loved the stage designs, costumes, and visual creation of the world. I think the creators of the series have the right hearts, and I am convinced that they care about the world in the games, become familiar with it, and bring it to the screen. I also felt like the actors absorbed the characters.The most likely criticism that I guess people will bring to the series, especially from fans of the first two games and New Vegas, is that the series is made too comedic, the seriousness is reduced, and the serious concepts in the source material are lacking. I strongly disagree. Fallout was always a bit of a post-apocalyptic world parody. The intensity of this increased in the third game. In the 4th game, this became the dominant atmosphere in the story. As someone who hasn't played 76, the series continues from where the 4th game left off the brand, so it didn't bother me at all. Moreover, I find it quite shallow those who believe that a work becomes valuable only with serious topics and philosophical depth.",9
"No Spoilers - With Nolan at the helm, can we finally have a good adaptation off of a video game?","First things first; as always, there will be no spoilers in this review.Fallout, as the title from a singular word suggests, is about the end of the world. A theme not estranged in the entertainment industry. On the contrary, it is one of the most handled topics. Rarely well done, often rushed and unimaginative. And while most forms of entertainment focus on the actual happening itself, Fallout focuses on... well... the fallout.The general timestamp of Fallout is around 200 years after the cataclysmic events. The show intrinsically weaves current and flashback-styled historic storytelling, the latter of which excellently constructs the base for the former. Without giving away too much about the plot, obviously, the show does it graciously, albeit with a hefty smear of gruesome details. And since Prime had one of its best successes with The Boys, which doesn't shy away from gore spectacles either, it's no surprise they gave the good ol' 'OK' for this path.The show is produced by many, but Jonathan Nolan is the main set piece for its production. He also directed the first 3 episodes himself, after which he gives the esteemed job to many other gifted directors. Clearly able to see each director's vision in each separate episode following number 3, it's Nolan's vision for the show that upholds high quality TV. There's a jungle out there of adaptations of different forms of entertainment, turned into other forms of entertainment. Surprisingly enough however, we do not possess a lot of adaptations of video games. Surprising, because, there is a vast pool of excellently told epic stories in the land of gaming. And we get The Witcher. Ouch.The mix of a producer and/or director with his or her own vision on the product seems a match made in heaven, as most adaptations choose a linear approach to the story told from its source of entertainment. That match works wonders for Fallout, and the result is a strong contender for one of the best TV shows to hit our wailing screens in 2024.While production and directing are important in the fulfillment of an 'epic' TV show, the cast is what we are confronted with as viewers as a more direct face of the show. And here, as pessimistic as one might be about adaptations, especially if you've consumed the base version first, the show comes truly comes to life. Grounded, strong and naive Lucy, played by a stellar Ella Purnell, is the show's most centric character, with its main storyline seemingly deriving from there.But Fallout tells a much bigger story than that. It tells the story of the naive that come to surface, the story of ghouls that lived longer than they should have, the story of communities and collections. Not necessarily supporting Lucy in her story, but rather constructing and building further upon the main arch, it's Walter Goggins and Moises Arias that further improve a stunningly strong cast. These are the main storylines, mind you, and there is so much grandness to be witnessed by just the smallest of characters. Layer after layer is peeled off. Even the smallest characters, with the littlest screen time, can have a rippling effect on the story told. And that's when you know you're watching something different. Entertainment that wants to achieve something only few can.Conclusively, the story of Fallout is twice. For the most part, it's about survival after literal life-ending events. For the smallest but perhaps most important part, it's about the ancient discussion of what can be considered 'good' and 'bad' in this new world, which will instantly be trickled down to the most profound desire of mankind: to persuade, willingly or unwillingly, others to your ideologies and beliefs. A story told such as that, with a good amount of self-mocking and imaginative violence, by a cast and production team that clearly lays its heart into its art, is entertainment in its purest and, quite frankly, best manner.So we ask: ""With Nolan at the helm, can we finally have a good adaptation off of a video game?"" Yes. Yes, we can.Rated 9 out of 10 bottle caps.",9
Style over substance,"We finished this series last night and I found it to be a grind - it was nice to look at + mostly entertaining with great set designs but the majority of the writing and acting was bad imo - B-grade quality.The tone and pacing could be all over the place at times.Lucy and Maximus irritated me the most with poor-average acting. Cooper was the most enjoyable but still far from the best acting work from Goggins.It was the Prime postapocalyptic equivalent of Disney's Star Wars, which was trash at it's core but they tried to make it aesthetically pleasing and throw in enough references for the fans.I've played a few Fallout games (not extensively but enough) and saw that they captured some of it well.Worth a look if you want something simple and entertaining but people are over-rating this.",6
Not a Gamer but enjoying this one,"As the title says, I had no idea this was a computer game although the title rung a bell. I think I'm maybe too old to play these computer games - over 60. But the series is worth a watch if you can allow leeway on some of the concepts & the blood.The does seem a lot of blood - how did we cope in the 1970s without it :-) in all those bond movies etc - This is an aspect of a lots of shows & films that I think needs looking at. It's not real and making it look real doesn't make the story any better. I'm not a prude by any means but where does this lead us in the long term? Just producers pushing the boundary further and the viewers getting less sensitised to gross events. This makes real violence more likely or if not, the violence that would happen anyway more twisted.Anyway, that my input on that. Fallout is enjoyable and I'll be watching the full series.",8
"Superficially flawless, but with a calamitously conceived retconning.","There's an awful lot to like here, both for hardcore fans of the games, and new or casual viewers.The visuals are absolutely spot on, with sets, costumes, props and many many Easter eggs all being taken directly from the games, right from the start where S. P. E. C. I. A. L. And skills are directly and cleverly referenced. The colour palette is more varied and the lighting is brighter, but this is a plus point: had it been shot in grimy, muted tones, it would have been jarring and anti-immersive.With a score either taken from, or influenced by, the games, there's nothing to complain about there either.The alternative-history of 2077 is equally well realised and convincing, although since it's filmed with the same palette as 2296, the flashback transitions aren't instantly obvious.Commendably, the showrunners don't shy away from the gore and gibs of the games, with some scenes verging on body horror. These are counterpoised with comic relief, and character drama, again consistent with the source. Most of the writing and dialog is solid, with some standout scenes: it takes a brave writer and director to have two main characters talk over each other with competing narratives, but it works here. There are a lot of characters and plotlines to juggle and interweave, but credit to the writers, they knit them together in the finale.The core cast is strong, with Ella Purnell in particular being wonderfully winning and convincing as the innocent-abroad Vault Dweller.However, there are significant flaws which have to be addressed.Finn - I mean, Maximus - is played competently by Aaron Moten, but he's far too old for the role. Ella Purnell is also 5 or 6 years beyond her part, but plays the ingénue more credibly, helped by those startling eyes.The treatment of Ghouls is wildly inconsistent. The writers can't make up their minds from one episode, or even one scene, to the next, whether they're near-indestructible superhumans or not. And this does matter because it would matter in-game.Sadly, the overarching plot for the season is a mystery box reveal which - as an original idea of CURRENT_YEAR Hollywood scriptwriters, aimed squarely at their own peers and the Modern Audience that they are convinced exists - is as infuriatingly farcical and ideologically driven as you'd imagine. It retcons an entirely new Fallout lore driven purely by virtue signalling from the most hypocritically enthusiastic beneficiaries of the very thing that the writers profess to eschew.Tragically, the final few scenes are simply an extended ""To be continued... question mark!"" montage. There's no conclusion here, just a tease that might be fulfilled in 3 or 4 years. Given the hectoring that was just delivered, and the lack of any firm premise about what future seasons might entail beyond more retconning flashbacks, this is a weak and insipid way to conclude what was shaping up to be a solid season. The writers simply ran out of ideas and punted the ball.",6
What..,"This series had a good plot but it would have been so much better if it weren't for Lucy and Max. I swear to God they are the most idiotic characters to ever exist. Firstly, I understand that Max ""doesn't know anything"" since he grew up in the Brotherhood but come on man, have some common sense. Even after everything he does to get the brotherhood to ""praise and respect"" him, it just makes him look like he has one SINGULAR brain cell. Lucy was a little bit better but all those dramatic pauses were just unnecessary. It shouldn't take her that long to make a decision when she has 2 brain cells. In the time these two characters pause and just STARE at nothingness while they are in danger I could get a college degree, find a husband, get married, have children, raise them, retire, and DIE. In conclusion, they are irritating and I will forever be their #1 HATER. On the other hand, the Ghoul and the dog seemed like the only actual normal characters. If I were him I would have shot them both as soon as they tried to reason while in the middle of the SHOOTING but ig he has more self-control. ""Okey-Dokey"", thats all. Peace out peeps.",4
The series made me write a review,"There was no inspiration to somehow write reviews of movies/series (having quality reviews of musical works and anime behind) on IMDb, and because of that I could not close ""Profile Checklist"".But, I loved this series so much that I decided to write to my friend a review quickly (literally in two minutes) review of it for him to start watching it right now and of why it's worth to watching and why this series is actually well made.Well, when lyrical digression is done for this review of ""questions - answers"" (that's what I called it) let's get down to it:
Are there any questions that arise during viewing?! - get answers!Do you want to watch the growth of the character?! - you have as many as 3 characters + one already formed + certain secondary characters can be added here.Do you want quality music?! - please, listen and add each one to the playlist in Spotify, and believe me, there are dozens of them here.Do you want an interesting plot?! - watch, think and get pleasure from a high-quality plot construction.Do you want drama?! - you can get handkerchiefs, of course there is not much glass here, but it is of high quality (I didn't cry because it doesn't work very well to me, but it is still of quite good quality).Do you want comedy?! - damn, this series is already a comedy (in a good way, of course).Do you want horror?! - oh, he won't make himself wait long.Do you want references to the game universe?! - don't worry, it is available here.The series is a bomb ;), I hope to watch it again someday and this second exp will definitely be successful!",10
it's good but why,"I liked this show a lot as a fallout fan for years and years. To start off with what i did not like is that for someone who maybe has not played the game and only watched the show is going to get a bad taste of sexism in the show... the show starting showing females being in power and taking charge while if the man wasn't a bad guy then he was a coward. But i think once the episodes keep going along you see that they live in a damn vault so it's expected. I loved it, but didn't like how quirky and or how naive lucy was i thought the character would be more like katniss everdeen just chill not loopy doopy not taking hints.",9
It is an excellent show with original storytelling but with its roots in the video game series.,"Hi there. I really enjoyed it! What I like best is that the characters are funny and extravagant, but they also have depth. For example, how most of the vault dwellers live in ignorance and comfort underneath the surface of the radioactive surface. In one scene, one of the characters, who is from the surface, is taken down into a Vault for the first time. It does not take long before he parted ways with the other protagonist sidekick, and he's isolated in his own room, feet up with a massive bowl of popcorn and watching a silly retro TV. He sees his friend being forcefully manhandled outside the window, and he is conflicted. He knows he should act as he looks longingly at the popcorn. And he does decide to act, and as he's psyching himself, he has one last big mouthful of popcorn, lol, it's such a great moment.Another one of my favourite scenes is when the ghoul is using the female protagonist as bait. So, he tied her up and lowered her into the water, where she obviously could not breathe and so began to drown. This is obviously torture, but he goes on an exposition about these 'studies' they used to do before the fallout. I won't be able to describe it here, but it was one of my favourite scenes from the whole thing. It makes me laugh remembering how chilled this guy is talking about old-fashioned studies while he's got this woman tied up and in mortal danger.There's much more to it as well, I highly recommend it and cannot wait for the next series which will probably come toward the back end of 2025.",8
Its good but not as good as the games,"I don't know what to say. There are parts about this show that really nailed it, and I mean they nailed it! And there are parts that don't. I can easily overlook many of the little things as the big ones definitively overshadow it. But its missing one key thing: Fallout did not hooked me in.I've played all the Fallout games long before it was made popular on the consoles. I did not play the new one that failed mind you. Overall, Fallout is probably my most favorite Game Franchise ever made. So why does it feel like it came short somewhere?I think its because in the games, you do have to use your imagination. In cinema, your kinda expected to show it. Now I don't think the dark side of Fallout needs to be shown like the Saw movies, cause that would put a lot of people off. The games were limited to cartoon graphics, and cartoon puns. It was a perfect combination. Fallout the TV show is trying to blend 2 different story telling mediums and somehow falls a little short in that.I don't think I'm making a good point here. Its just something I feel. Put another way, I'll probably one watch this once. But it does not have re-watch interest for me. But hey, maybe my expectations are too high and I just got to let it play out more. Its just the start. Lets see where Season 2 goes and maybe I will have to change my mind about Season 1.",8
shockingly amazing!!,"Never heard of the Fallout video game in my life, not much of a gamer, but i love Walton's work and have been following his cereer so I decided to give this a go. With having no expectations or preconceived notions about what this should be like or what stpryline this whould fallow, this show is absolutely the best piece of TV entertainment I've seen in my life. I mean, acting was excellent by almost everyone, photograpy, CGI...everything was amazing. SOme of the reviewrs comment on editing, or directing, I have no such evaluation skills, but lemme telll you, this show is well worth your time....binge it!",10
Best show out there,"I haven't been able to find a good show in a long time until now and it is now my favorite show. I'm already binge watching it all over again it's that good. Just like the game and it makes you want to play the game all over again when you're done watching the series. It's a MUST WATCH!! And the actors are phenomenal. All three main character stories makes you glued to the tv. It's full of fantasy, action, romance, comedy and horror. This show seems like it's going to be big and I'm all up for it. My whole family is now addicted to. You don't have to play the game in order to watch the series.",10
"Entertaining, but found this post apocalyptic world a bit too light hearted, and the ending shallow","My favorite part of the entire series was the opening sequence that shows the bombs dropping, and even that I had some issues with, like nukes dont explode slowly enough for people to have time to say ""oh no honey thats just smoke from a fire"" (watch the trinity test footage). Im all for dramatic effect, but make it realistic. That being said, the scene was intense and beautifully acted by Goggins and I got goosebumps. Sadly the rest of the series didnt have the same effectThe fallout series took a tone shift with the arrival of Fallout 4. Prior to that, yes humor and absurdity were present, but they were sprinkled in amongst the backdrop of a desolate dying world with cruelty and horror around every corner. In fallout 3, often the first person you encounter is a homeless guy begging for a sip of clean water. He's not goofy, weird, or absurd in any way, he's just a normal human. There are slavers that keep kids in cages with bomb collars around their neck. Thats the kind of world we're in. The show however feels like its turned that formula on its head. It feels more like humor and absurdity are now the primary focus with sprinklings of reminders that ""oh dont forget we're in a post apocolyptic wasteland"". And Fallout 4, which the show seems to be most emulating, seemed to be the beginning of that tone shift, where the colors were a little brighter, the characters a little wackier, the sense of dread a little less present. The show has taken this to the next level with brotherhood knights that act like delinquent teenagers, organ harvesting drug dealers that watch tv all day and act like stoners, and a goofy brain in a roomba being the mastermind behind a vault conspiracy. I wanted more scenes and characters like norm, moldaver, charlie whiteknife, and barbara, who took their circumstances very seriously and whose perfomances sucked me into the world.Then there's the issue of certain elements of the show feeling hollow and not given the weight or depth they deserve. Like the scene where all the big corporations are meeting with vault tec. It seemed way too easy for a meeting like that to have been spied on, barbara even noticed her pipboy was transmitting but decided to still attend that meeting with it on? Come on. Then she just casually says in the meeting ""by dropping the bomb ourselves"" admitting to all these ceo's present that vault tec is considering creating the nuclear holocaust themselves. Info like that you'd barely share with people inside the company let alone blurting it out point blank to other companies unless you know they're fully on board. And all these ceo's present were ok with the end of the world, the end of their empires, in exchange for a few vaults where they could run human experiments? Maybe they were but they didnt give any indication as to why. And vault tec said this would be an opportunity to end conflict by outliving all enemies and having a single monopoly. How? When you're giving away vaults to other companies with their own ideas on how to run things how does that result in a single monopoly and not just another bunch of factions bickering and warring over the right way to do things? It feels like there's so much missing here, so much that has been glossed over and just thrown together without attention to detail or nuance. This is the kind of meeting that you'd find in a climactic scene of a show like 24 or Homeland, where multiple government agencies have expended mind boggling amounts of time and resources to get a recording of, that we as the viewer have been slowly piecing together over the course of the season, but in fallout this incredibly precious info feels unearned and like its just being lazily told to us for a plot point. The idea that vault tec started the war is something that people have been speculating since the inception of the fallout series and it didnt feel like the grand revelation it deserved to be.Another culprit of this was the scene where Lucy learns about her father. I didnt buy the father's performance trying to stop Moldaver from revealing the truth. And Lucy seemed to accept this reality way too easily (you're gonna believe that your father who you love nuked a town cause some lady who killed your friends and family told you so?) Again just lacked depth and nuance and left me wanting.My hope for season 2 is that we get more depth and nuance and the creators lean more into the gritty nature of the earlier fallout entries and lose some of the ""oh darn i missed every shot cause I suck without a scope on"" goofiness.",6
Surprisingly very good,"I was sceptical at first thinking it was the band wagon after ' The Last of Us' and then 'Halo'. Perhaps it is. Yet, this was (S1) anyway, engaging from the start. A different take on many apocalyptic stories, but a good cast who played their roles extremely well. It was great to see Kyle ''Agent Cooper' MacLachlan demonstrate how underrated an actor he is. Also the strange and bit scary guy from Lost played his part impeccably.Yes it's a video game story. Yes it's a bit daft. But the music, script, a pretty good acting made this enjoyable. I hope season 2 lives up to the promise this season did.",9
Fast paced and satisfying,"Someone who's not played the games but was aware of the lore and visuals of fallout, I was pleasantly surprised to be taken on an almost instantaneous, bizzaro joyride through an apocalyptic Americana. Great performances running throughout, with a nearly unmatched fast pace that leaves you no time to pause, something I find lacking in so much TV of today. Walton Goggins is as usual excellent, a layered and confident performance. The set dressing, locations and costume work are all superb, worn out, destroyed and strikingly impressive. Worth a watch for anyone who enjoyed the high energy and violence of 1980s sci-fi, great fun!",
Could have been better,"If you are a gamer & played Fallout 3 or 4, the nostalgic elements will draw you in immediately. Most of the elements in the game has been used to come up with this storyline. Even the naivete of the vault dwellers.The violence level is on par with the games or possibly more.They could have introduced more factions instead of only the Brotherhood of Steel and brought out more dystopian outlook by showing many factions warring with one another to get hold of the tech.Additionally, they could have gone with a male protagonist instead, keeping in line with the original Fallout series tradition. The actress playing the protagonist is not good with her acting. You don't really relate with her struggle onscreen rather, you wonder why she is so dumb and co-dependent.Male protagonist would have suited the Fallout story much better.",6
"Good potential, squandered","I really, really wish I could have given this a 10. The actors are great (for the most part) and the decorations and setting mostly hit the right spot, but everything else falls very flat.From the perspective of a longtime Fallout fan, this can't count as a good adaptation of the West Coast. Not when all the lore has been retconned to hell and back. LA had a giant, successful city, Angel's Boneyard? Not anymore. Shady Sands is now there. Though, wait, no it isn't, it is now nuked. Why? By who? Is this the end of the NCR? The lack of NCR presence seems to indicate so. Why though? Why are the survivors squatting in Griffith Observatory, when there are NCR cities all around? Where is New Reno, San Francisco, the Hub? Presumably they are the same place as the Angel's Boneyard: gone from the lore, to make place for a dumb fun Mad Max setting.The same retconning goes for the factions. West Coast Brotherhood was on its last legs? Nope, they now have metal airships and a gigantic base, as well as enough military might to conquer the nearby shantytown. For no reason. Don't get me started on the Enclave, they should have all been wiped out long ago with NCR persecution of former members. But no, they are now scientifically advanced, have a big facility... somewhere, and an unlimited power source, which they had zero ways of getting since it belonged to Vault Tec, who also kept the activation codes for it. How did they manage to get the newest McGuffin but not the codes? No idea. Maybe that's on me, I don't know, if I accidentally skipped a scene where that's explained please let me know.But even if you aren't a huge lore nerd like me, the inconsistencies and plot holes will still drive you nuts. I already mentioned the whole Enclave fiasco, but this is not the only thing that is simply introduced for no reason and not explained anywhere (except maybe, MAYBE, in a potential season 2). Why is Moldaver alive after 200 years? It is strongly implied that Lucy's mother was the first to leave the Vault, otherwise Shady Sands would have been nuked way earlier. So cryo is out. So is ghoulification. No reason for her to still look almost exactly the same, when she should be a skeleton by now. What about the invincibility serum Thaddeus gets? Cause it sure as hell didn't make him a ghoul, as Maximus said. Ghouls can't take an arrow to the neck. Why does a random guy have that? Why was he in danger earlier if he has the vaccine to all injury? So many questions, so few answers.The smaller inconsistencies are a little less in your face, but they are still noticeable. Power armor can now crush skulls, bring down buildings and throw bricks at near bullet speed, but only when it is not inconvenient to the plot. When Titus is fighting the Yao Guai, when Maximus is fighting the Ghoul, when the Brotherhood assaults the NCR remnants, it barely gives an edge. Except for Titus. There it was more of an impediment. Why did Snip-Snip sew a finger onto Lucy if she was going to be harvested for organs anyway? How did Vault 4 find Maximus' power armor when he left it far beyond the bridge? Why did the ghoul shoot the Enclave scientist's leg off? If he wanted to get a live bounty, why give him a life threatening injury that makes it way harder to move him? If he wanted him dead, why aim for the leg? How did Enclave guy ever get out of the base? How the hell does Maximus not know there are people in the Vaults, when everyone on the surface seems to know (and for some reason hate the Vault dwellers). Such inconsistencies are small, and some can be hand waved away. But after the first couple of times, it becomes increasingly harder to suspend one's disbelief and let this slide. This is lazy writing, plain and simple.Once again I truly wish I could give this a higher number, as I had very high hopes from all the good reviews and my friends' recommendations, which were unfortunately not realized. I loved Lucy, and though I often did not understand what they were doing with Maximus, he had his moments. Norm was also solid, I'd say the Vault story was the most engaging, though it is a tad bit spoiled by the knowledge of Vault experiments most Fallout players have, which causes them to never doubt that there is something shifty in 31,32 and 33. I give this show a 3, one for Lucy's character surviving the writing thanks in no small part to the actress, and for Norm, and two for decorations and sets. Please, improve in 2nd season. Don't mess up New Vegas.",2
Happily surprised,"I love the Fallout game series, but with Bethesda's handling of it, and their recent disaster being Starfield, I didn't expect this to be good. Obviously they didn't make the series, but being the IP holder and ones who have influenced the new stories, which I'd say have been lacklustre, their involvement at all gave a bad smell to this series. Accompanied by really corny Hollywood marketing, I expected this to be a mainline show directed at normies, and not actual fans of the games. I'm happy to say that's not the caseWhile Fallout has some corny parts, and typical Hollywood moments, it's never offensive enough to deter. The writing doesn't take itself as seriously as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners or Arcane, being my two favourite game adaptations, but Fallout has always had its goofy side, being a satirical narrative about post-war politics, so it didn't really hurt my viewing experience as it may have done with others.If you're a fan of the games, I can say that it is directly appealing to the newer generation of games, from Fallout 3 and onwards, and even New Vegas for the ones who lean out of the Bethesda camp. Fallout 1 had some references, but the first two games really take a back seat and more so exist as a benchmark of story accuracy and making sure the timelines are good. I've yet to see any references or tie-ins to those games, while aesthetically it pulls from Fallout 4, and it also shares a number of the same locations from Fallout 4. Towards the end we see some tie-in to Fallout: New Vegas which gets me excited.Story wise we follow multiple characters, that all have converging narratives. The story isn't anything particularly amazing, feeling more like a bunch of side stories tied together. In a way it feels akin to a game story, which I'm all for. The details flesh out the world and the lore a bit more, and in a way that I personally like.The main selling point is the set design, with characters, clothes, power armour, locations, all looking high quality. Every episode is such a treat visually, and it makes you want to go back and play the games just to experience the world of Fallout again. This in-of-itself makes the show worth watching. When the music kicks in, and the vibe is just right, it makes me smile, and that in itself is enough for me to recommend the show.Fallout is the best live action game adaptation I've seen, and I'm so glad that it didn't fall into the same trappings as The Witcher did.",8
"Before ""The Last of Us""","This game came out before ""The Last of Us"", and that game is just a more brutal adaptation of this game. Both series, as a result are quite good. After watching both, I can honestly say that I prefer this version. Its dark humour, its dystopian I love it. The choice of music is excellent and adds to the dystopian feel of the show. I can't wait to see what they do with the second series in the show. The ending certainly opens up a bunch of possibilities.This show is really about a version of Edgar Allan Poe's ""the Story of Dr. Tar and Professor Feather"", or as they say in the show ""what happens when the ranchers have more power than the sheriff"". In the end, we still don't find out, really. We just see that they are just two sides of the same coin.",8
Best ever video game adaptation? Yup,"Never played the games, but being a gamer for 30 plus years you gotta be living u der a rock to know the lore or Fallout. Always a game I wanted to play but never the time to play it. This series is by far one of, if not the, best gaming adaptations yet! The characters are absolutely amazing and Walton Goggins' ghoul character is my absolute favourite!! From what I've seen via walkthroughs and reviews I've read on the games, it seems to follow them with plenty of easter eggs and that's coming from someone who never played the games. I can only imagine that hard-core fans will find many more hidden easter eggs than myself. I'd say the series is on par with the last of us and halo (although halo is a mixed bag for many hard-core fans due to master chief removing his helmet), maybe better by a small margin bur we shall see where season 2 takes us but I'm pretty sure new Vegas is the setting for that. Can't wait!!If your a gamer.....watch it!!! If your not, fear not, its still an amazing show and you really don't need to know anything from the games as the important details are all explained as it goes.",10
Finally a movie does the games justice! :),"As someone who has been a fan of the Fallout games for many years now, this series is something very special it does a very good job capturing and bringing to life the franchise to a live action format. Watching this made me go redownload New Vegas and 76 lol. 10/10 highly recommend the show.The only thing that I would like to maybe see in season 2 is to potentially see some characters or areas that are unique to specific fallout games. It could be a blast to see some of that brought to life to satisfy even more of that itch for some nostalgia from the various games we enjoyed before we were gifted the show.",10
Absolutely perfect,"If you're not a fan, you're in for a treat, but for fans it hits home on different levelsI'm a massive Fallout fan. Been one through all the games starting with Fallout 2 and working my way back. I've had dozens of playthroughs of the games by now and probably going to get going with another one soon!I distinctly remember the anticipation for Fallout 3 after a long wait. The wait for the series has been similar. After the success of Witcher I felt Fallout with its extensive lore could be great and was really holding out hope.EP 1 felt right and familiar. EP 2 felt like being transported into a typical Fallout game plot line. It's the little things they do throughout. You can see the care and love that went into this.Then the end, leaning in to decade-long fan theories, was just the cherry on the cake.This was absolute pure nostalgic indulgence and I can't wait for more. I just want some muties worth super sledges and a deathclaw or two!If you're not a fan, you're in for a treat, but for fans it hits home on different levels!",10
Surprisingly good!,"I have to say that I have no idea about the storyline of any games that there are. I started watching fallout, mainly because of the good reviews that it has, and it did not disappoint. Having in known that many of tv shows/ movies made after video games are in a lot of cases pretty bad, this one really blew my mind. It has to be one of the best tv show i have watched in some time to be honest, and I do watch a lot of 'em. Quite surprised by the story (having in known that I did not know it) and the interpretation of it, because it could've been a disaster, but they handled it really well. I might actually play the games after this one haha.",9
Great show!,"Show was really good. Had a great mix of original content and elements from the actual lore. The comedy was great and not forced. The only thing that's keeping this from a 10 is a really outstanding character arc. I didn't really get attached to any one character, though all of them were great(except Michael rappaport, screw that guy). Besides the characters, the music choice and setting were amazing. Looked exactly like something you'd see from playing new Vegas or 4. They even chose music that wasn't ever in the games but fit the show perfectly which was really good. Overall, the show is a great intro series and I hope it leads to many more seasons.",
"It's ok, with some weird stuff","While the TV series has received a lot of 10/10 reviews, I would encourage you to take those with a grain of salt. The show is decent, but it's not necessarily the groundbreaking, must-watch experience that some commenters make it out to be.As expected, the series does include representation for the raibow community, with a girls who uses made-up pronouns. However, I was disappointed to see the inclusion of a ""person of short stature"" and other minority characters that felt more like box-checking than genuine, well-developed representation.Overall, the TV series is worth watching if you're interested in the premise and have the time. But if you're looking for a truly exceptional viewing experience, you might be better off playing the original game that inspired the show. It seems to capture the essence of the source material more effectively.d.",6
So impressed,"Although I'm not the one playing, I love supporting my husband by watching and helping him as he plays. I keep an eye on the surroundings and alert him to any loot or incoming enemies. After hundreds of hours, I've even built my own collections in every settlement he constructs-even an island teeming with gorillas. Watching this show brings that same thrill and enjoyment. The storyline, humor, atmosphere, scenery, and the Junk Gun are all purely delightful! I appreciate that they embraced the adult humor instead of watering it down for a broader audience. It's also exciting to see how the show expands the lore and raises new questions. I'm eagerly anticipating what unfolds in season two.",10
"Yes, I played the games...","...but my rating is about the TV series. It's beautiful, well-produced, and serviceably acted by a strong cast. But ultimately for me, the television show is only as strong as the dialogue and it's action.The dialogue in the show is weak, and the action doesn't really put us or the characters in difficult situations where they have to make tough choices.The overarching quest narrative is kind of weak, but the characters have kept me interested, I just wish they said more interesting, articulate , and significant things.I'm willing to see where this show goes, but it is not, as many reviews say, the best adaptation of a video game so far.",6
Fallout reviews are a lie this show is trash.,"Fallout as a game has always had amazing lore and game design and being the person I tend to just naturally check reviews before watching a show to see consistent 5 stars and 97% rotten tomatoes. Is this a joke? Perhaps a collective prank just like morbius I honestly don't know.*spoilers from episode 1 and 2 below*The acting is awful but not just awful but the script these actors have to read from don't even help. Quite literally the worse dialogue I've had to listen too. I understand the concept that vault dwellers are naive but there is being naive and then being quite literally stupid with the huge lack of any survival instinct to the point where maybe the little genetic diversity due to them being all cousins has canonically made them all cognitively impaired. Lucy's ignorance is unbearable: giving her only water bottle to a complete stranger on the surface who looks like he would rob her for everything? This is way past her being simply naive, she's just an idiot. The dialogue between her and the ghoul was so cringeworthy I was ready to turn off the show right then, as I realised that maybe Lucy's stupidity may not be satirical.Going back to episode 1 when the raiders were killing the people of vault 33 with the exception of a few 33 vault dwellers putting in some effort to stopping them, majority did absolutely nothing. Not only was there no sense of urgency and lack of security (I mean as they were all fighting, two people were still carrying food on a tray casually oblivious to the shooting of guns and the screaming? Something that was heard even from Lucy all the way in her room with the door locked).Maximus....honestly it's like the show wants me to hate these characters how can someone with even little screen time be so annoying. The scene between him and the cult leader during his interrogation was once again a hard watch. He's not even interesting , he's not likeable, he's probably cried more than he's spoken and he's a terrible knight. Talking about the knights (the guys in the power armour) they are obviously shown to be these intimidating/strong and trusted fighters for the brother of steel yet when one of them comes in contact with a mutated bear resorted to the ""act dead"" approach and had to rely on his squire with just a pistol to take it down for him. Pay in mind this is the same knight who was saying ""I just what to shoot something right now"" and dropping off the helicopter early just to be a complete embarrassment. What's more stupid is that as Maximus was going to stim him so he didn't die the knight in the power amour saw this as an opportunity to absolute incinerate maximus for no reason despite maximus being the one to decide his survival and the one who saved him in the first place. I thought these guys underwent vigorous training and even some education yet the chosen knights all share a singular brain cell apparently.This show is awful. The acting is awful. Dialogue is awful. I really don't care about Lucy or Maximus to be honest they are both equally unlikeable and I really don't understand how the reviews on this show are high considering the terribly non-engaging plot and awful creation of 2D characters.Don't watch it it's not worth your time.",1
The whole time I was watching this show I was in disbelief that I'm actually watching a show in the Fallout universe. I'm in love,"I don't write many reviews but when I do it's either something really good or something really garbage that I'm amazed how it was made.Fallout is so good that I'm actually going to re watch it again this week.The scene where Lucy uses a stimpack and it makes that hissing sound, I pauses the show, stood up and started clapping for a minute.Then it was a joy ride from start to finish. I enjoyed everything in the show. The characters, the visuals, the power armor, the creatures.Standout actors are Walton Goggins, Ella Pumell, Moises Arias and Dave Register.As for Aaron Clifton, I didn't like his character at the beginning but then understood it and it's dry comedy and he's a favourite now as wellPlease watch this show and let's get a second season.",9
Wow Actually Great,"Wouldn't even know it's a videogame adaptation. Good setting, culturally relevant, good acting, non-cliched... These guys actually have a hit on their hands.1. I really hope this gets a season 2, and hopefully we retain the writers and nobody ruins it.2. Walton Goggins, what an OG man. This guy never fails to make the room more interesting, no matter how big the set is.3. The two kids playing the other mains, solid story, romance, and acting. The way Maximus plays wounded but struggling to continue is absolutely terrific, his facial expressions are top class. Same with the vault dweller chick playing the naive but pure hearted chick guys just fall in love with. Well played. Continue, season 2, don't screw it up, ty.",10
Just a great show,"Well done Jonathan Nolan and team, zero notes.Whether you're a fan of the games or not, this is a great show that stands on its own two feet. It's fun, action-packed, funny, a little philosophical, there's mystery, charming characters, and a fully realised world lifted straight from the games (particularly Fallout 3 & 4) and adapted successfully for the small screen.The world of video game adaptions is a murky one, with many horrendous, insulting, laughably awful movies and shows based on masterful pieces of fiction that seem, to everyone who takes the time to play them, boxed and ready to go to be adapted into something great. They never are, recently The Last of Us felt pretty close to greatness but everything it is was lifted straight from the game it was based on, almost word for word, almost shot for shot.This show is its own thing completely, it's a brand new story and it manages to recapture the magic and essence of the Fallout video game franchise AND fit into its canon. This is the first great video game adaption, which is wonderful for ALL video game fans after the slurry we've been forced to eat again and again. But most of all, and what I'm really happy about, is it's a great TV show, full stop.",8
I cannot believe how good I feel as a Fallout fan,"Everyone who has ever played any of the games and liked them has their own take on what a show like this should be like I think. As a hardcore Fallout fan myself I had such high expectations of my own that I was certain that my the bar was set too high. But - just wow.Like so many have said- the props, the detail, the sometimes illogical quest lines, the quirky dialogue- and most of all- that illusive ""Fallout feeling"" that the game gives you that I thought would be impossible to recreate- it's all there, and then some!! So damned pleased with this. And the cocky Mr Goggins is excellent as Hancock- sorry Cooper 😅. Even Dogmeat makes an appearance.The scene in ep 7 where Lucy holds up the flag and Inon Zurs EXCELLENT Fallout 4 theme plays is one of THE biggest goosebump moments of my life lol.I want more, more, MORE!!",10
From a Viewer to Gamer,"I don't kbow much about Fallout when it came out, haven't played any Fallout game before and unknown what this movie about. But after 1 episode, I had to download and spent every day to played this game!So If you haven't played any Fallout versions like me, don't be worry.There is something extremely attractive about this film, from the frames, characters to the music and the plot are all at 9-10/10. For who played game before, you should enjoy the movie and don't take it seriously because it's just a beginning of Fallout series.The movie've done great job while illustrates apocalypse word, Vault-Tec, Wasteland, fractions....To compare between movie vs game version, let's call the it's live-action version with brilliant new storyline from Jonathan Nolan. It described pretty accurate to the game, we shouldn't put in much expectations while its just a frist season so...Hope to see Season 2!!!",10
"""Phonedin""","""Phonedin"" the Amazon Studios adaptation of Fallout has major plot holes, is riddled with inconsistencies, and it totally fails in capturing the feeling of the source material. The dialogue is totally PhonedIn, the acting is Phonedin, animations are PhonedIn. The story suffers from a major lack of substance. With a TEN hour running time the moral of the story can be summarized to the banal ""Intro to Phil"" Trolley Problem.The pre-existing universe should have made the job relatively easy for the showrunners instead they make huge blunders that totally defeat the purpose of the original story and what it was trying to achieve. The worst aspect of the show, even more awful than rendering the story meaningless, are the absolutely horrid attempts at humor and acting. The showrunners repeatedly try to use the original humor of fallout as a crutch for introducing all sorts of awful lines, jokes and socially incompetent behavior. All 30, 40, 50, 60yo act like teenagers? Hey Bud don't question it! It's because it is a postapocalyptic world.Wherever you look in PhonedIn, whether it be the story or the experience, you won't be left disappointed if you come knowing it is PhonedIn.",
A faithful adaptation with an identity crisis,"This and One Piece stand as case studies of how to make a proper adaptation - one that both satisfies fans and makes a good standalone series for newcomers. As someone with little previous exposure to the source material, I found this highly enjoyable in its own right. The sets and visuals are incredibly well produced, not a single actor was unconvincing andThat being said, it did fall victim to the common pitfalls of such ambitious projects. The show tries to be gory and harrowing in much the same way as Game of Thrones, but in a very Season 8 manner. Main characters are invincible to any setbacks, injuries and threats to their life, with an irritating amount of deus ex machina (being conveniently saved at the last minute). Not to mention that overplayed timing issue, in which a character is saved because their attacker is conveniently slow to hurt them. If a main character does get injured, it has absolutely no consequence and is usually rectified within the next couple scenes. They also must have lacked sufficient b-roll because they replayed one character's exact same flashback about 6 or 7 times, without it even serving much purpose.While the show manages to pull off most of its goals, it attempts to establish itself as gritty and unforgiving, yet contradicts itself in each of its plots. For the vast majority of viewers, though, these types of oversights are par for the course in modern entertainment, and likely wouldn't hinder the experience.",7
one of the best video game adaptions to date,"One of the best video game adaptions to date, with a top of the line performance from Ella Purnell, hard to believes she's been in two of the best adaptions so far I absolutely loved her in Arcane
and she killed it with both roles. Great humor, very fallout like and also dare i say perfect performance from both supporting leads, Walton Goggins the ghoul who had a tragic story to his character but still comes out on top as the most badass in the wasteland and Aaron Clifton, Lucy new brotherhood boyfriend, they bring so much life to this show, I'm very excited for season 2. War, War never changes.",9
Good except last episode let me down,Really good except for the last episode. The motivation for the corporate types to do what they did is just not realistic. It's silly even. The writers let themselves down with that episode. There's no way a group of corporate leaders would intentionally nuke the world so they can do social experiments in a bunker. It doesn't make any sense at all. It's amazing that this was the best idea they could think of.Good up to that point. Interesting enough to considerActing was good and the main characters likable with good character development throughout.Some nudity in the show that was entirely unnecessary.,6
"""Hard to tell.. show me the illustration""","I know about Fallout, as I've picked up on it through cultural exposure, but never directly.This show makes me feel like I should at least play New Vegas! Because, while the visuals and execution are decent-to-good, it does a poor job at making me care about anything that's going on. From charmless actors with boring and unlikeable characters, horrible pacing and plenty of empty drawn-out moments... to dull writing, dialogues and interactions. No particular element grabbed my attention, and I felt finishing this show was a chore I had to get through.I'm saddened at the delivery of what seemed like a promising new show to watch.. but it reminds me a lot of all the problems I had with the later Westworld seasons, where nothing was particularly interesting.",5
Boomer says... B+,"This show surprised me.The first episode or two had me thinking ""why bother, this is stupid/ridiculous"" (no, I haven't played the game). But kept into it, and by the third/fourth episode it had me curious if not hooked. (This is likely the difference between our older generation's comic book oriented upbringing versus computer game storytelling. 🤣)Yes, there are obvious problems with the science fiction/fact details but nothing serious that totally kills the story. It was compelling enough to finish out all 8 episodes. The whole premise is ridiculous but it is presented in an entertaining way, so as far as popcorn sci-fi (which is not a compliment) it's good enough.We do need another season of Fallout, as long as the writing keeps up.",9
Successfully capture the soul of the games,"As an avid nerd of the Fallout games, I was naturally extremely skeptical of this series going into the first episode.I must say I was very pleasantly surprised. They manage to combine the uniquely bleak feel of the Fallout universe with a reasonably coherent storyline and great characters.Add on top a healthy mix of mordibly dark humour and lots of senseless violence and you got yourself a great watch for any Fallout fan.Not sure how it would hold up for people who haven't played the games given the majority the backstory to the Fallout universe is explained in the games themselves and probably seem silly without context.",10
The details matter,"The attention to details spread throughout from the game are greatly appreciated. The story was good, but for a fan of the game, seeing this world come to life was the real win. The world of Fallout is quirky and weird and the show captured that. This is meant to be true to that, not an adaptation to anything plausible beyond the world created in the games. For me that's a win.Memorable characters and tons of cameos tell you how beloved the franchise is. Lots of known actors are happy to play bit roles, just to be a part of this project. It's not for everyone, I'm sure, but if you liked the games and you want to see it come to life, you'll enjoy this. I know I did.",9
S01 done and it's decent.,"Walking in I was sceptical. Having been really only into the fallout universe since fallout 3, I wasn't a purist. The budget and effects whilst not ""perfect"" are certainly not janky enough to detract from the visual spectacle. The characters are unique and flawed, there so far seems to me an absence of ""the message"" and it's a good , fun watch. Is it a mind blowing experience? No, is it a fun hour watching some post apocalyptic mayhem? Yes certainly. There is no absence of gore and a plethora of nostalgia. For me that wasn't enough not to like and it is probably one of the best ""game to screen"" adaptations so far. For me above ""The Last Of Us"".",8
Great TV show. Best game adaptation.,"It's like the games and the spirit would have come to a tv show. Also it's a great production, story and acting.It's fascinating how they managed to merge the brutality, conspiracy and humor of the game without making it stupid. Once started it's hard to stop.I wonder how Amazon came up with this and how they managed it to make it a great show without utilizing any political agenda.Hope they will produce more of fallout content and further connect the dots between the games, stories, missions and characters. Maybe also showing a way into a prosperous scenario of the world.Thanks for bringing that show.",10
Best female lead anything I've ever seen,"It's a show based off the fallout video game series of a dystopian future, where a chosen few fled underground during the 60's in order to survive the nuclear holocaust, for the survival of human civilization!It's kind of a fun idea where even though its sci-fi and based in the future the people all still act like they're in the 60's. The characters have a vibe sort of like the movie ""Once upon a time in Hollywood,"" so that idea alone is already so clever that its easy to escape from reality to tune into this series. The trend right now for any show or movie is to have a female lead cast and I think they found the perfect one with Ella Purnell who plays Lucy Maclean who is the daughter of ""The Overseer"" of vault 33. When her father is kidnapped a young, brave and naive Lucy feels obligated to venture out of their protective vault and into the unknown nuclear bomb ravaged surface in order to rescue her father, so that vault 33 can continue to be as its always been: peaceful and pleasant. The success of the show is anchored by Lucy's curiosity about everything that she comes across in the outside world as we're introduced to new characters and places she comes across while Lucy showcases her true beauty inside and out in her unwavering moral compass in her need to always do the right thing! It's the ultimate fight of good vs evil as the kind hearted main characters of the show deal mostly with corrupted souls who have been conditioned that way by the crooked world where they had to adapt that way in order to survive! Lots of comedy and violence sprinkled in throughout!I give this one a 9/10 and a must watch for anyone who says ""The perfect female lead doesn't exist.......""",9
I've been waiting 25 years for this,"As a long time fan of the original Fallout 1 and 2 as well as New Vegas I was a bit hesitant to how this should would be written as the narrative of the Bethesda adaptations never lived up to the heritage of the original Interplay games or the Obsidian/Black Isle New Vegas game with their amazing narratives - which in my opinion Fallout 3 and 4 never reached..I was happily surprised as I avoided any trailers and hype before I saw the first episode. The intro music from Fallout had me smiling and there was enough fan service to keep me smiling.I saw the entire series with my wife, who did not play the original games but she did play New Vegas, although she wasn't a fan the same as me. She did however enjoy the series once we got a few episodes into it. Of course I gave her a live commentary to the lore of the fallout universe and I can't say for sure how someone who with no additional information about the background story would enjoy this series. But hopefully that extra depth will just add to the enjoyment and if you are curious there are a lot of videos on youtube to give you a summary of the previous 200 years.I know there was some controversy about how some lore was potentially ignored from New Vegas. I'm not sure it holds, but even if it does I feel like it doesn't take much away from the enjoyment of this series for me.It still has the dark humor, the gore, the cynical world where there really aren't any good guys. And that is what makes this world so special. I think this was a really good adaption. The female lead is not the boring strong female character that has no faults and therefore no character arc. She develops in every episode. And so do the other characters. You get more backstory and by the end I was very excited for more.I think there was a good balance here to introduce the major traits of this world for new fans as well as old and now I care enough that I am also worried, because I haven't cared for a series since season 5 of game of throne ended.I hope they keep honoring the lore and spirit in which the Fallout universe was created. This is a great show in a time where such are few and far between. And unlike most things produced by Hollywood lately there was very little Message and preaching. The story delivered and that is what should always matter most. I hope more studios learn from this.",9
"Beautifully Produced, Underwhelmingly Written","While there is certainly a lot to praise in this rendition of the Fallout universe, I still can't really call myself a fan of this show.Beginning with the praise, this show was beautiful to look at. The cinematography was strong, the costumes were great, the production design was absolutely fantastic, and the visual effects were well done. Basically every technical aspect of the show was very well done and often times exceptionally so.The makeup for the ghouls was excellent, the designs for the creatures and world were stylish and interesting, and the action sequences were well choreographed and well executed.Beyond the technicals, the show's cartoonish tone and sense of humor was sometimes very effective. There were a few times that it made me chuckle, no doubt. And I was genuinely impressed with the setup of the story. The initial scene that established the Nuclear Fallout was excellent, and Lucy's introduction was very well done. You get a real sense of who she is almost immediately and are drawn into her perspective effortlessly.Part of that is the lead actress' talent. In fact, nearly every member of the cast performed their roles quite well (with a few notable exceptions).And overall, despite my criticisms (which I'll get into), there were definitely moments in the story that were entertaining and engaging. I was curious about the mysteries the show introduced and was interested enough to follow it to the conclusion.But that's all the praise I have to offer. Now, I'm afraid, is the time to discuss my criticisms.For one thing, the story's cartoonish tone and sardonic attitude made it hard for me to really get invested in the dramatic aspects of the story. And the show definitely wanted me to be invested and really care for the big dramatic revelations during the finale, but I just wasn't buying into it. The final episode was full of big twists that I saw coming a mile away (partly because they were very unsubtle in setting them up) but also because it's actually such a cliche trope at this point. The father character, who the protagonist idealized, is actually a bad man... SO SHOCKING!I found the introduction for Lucy's story to be interesting but as it went on it just repetitive and less and less engaging as it went on. Her disillusionment felt forced. It was driven by a series of reveals where things she admired or cared about were systematically deconstructed and shown to be evil all along, just like her dad. And over and over that just kept happening, and it just became trite and predictable before long. I didn't feel any emotion for her story in the final episode.The Ghoul (who's also the cowboy actor, I'm forgetting his name) also had the same arc and his character was a symbol of the deconstructionist mentality of the entire script. His false cowboy identity is the perfect metaphor for what this story is saying overall. The ""cowboy"" is a myth that's just a nice looking mask for bad men who were violent and what not. That heroic ideal isn't real, it's just a mask. Just like the Ghoul's wife isn't really a good woman, she's a cartoonishly evil corporate monster who pretends to be good. The one thing I actually like though about the cowboy angle is how it's a reversal of Lucy's role in the story. The cowboy tames the wilderness, Lucy is made wild by the wilderness. That was pretty cool.Easily the worst character in the story was Maximus. His contribution was so bland and poorly executed, I wondered why they even included it. He was a character I really felt nothing for. They didn't stress what his attachment or investment in anything was. I never felt his motivations properly. I observed that he was unhappy with being bullied, I guess. But his murderous lying attitude made him fundamentally unlikable and stopped my from pittying him like I think the script wanted me to. His plotlines are overly driven by convenience and contrivance, and he's ultimately given a redemption arc that feels entirely unearned. He also has a very thin and emotionless romance with the lead that I felt absolutely nothing for. His friendship with the nonbinary brother was emotionless as well. I just felt like every scene with him was a waste of screen time.Oh and did I mention that not all the humor is funny? And that when it isn't funny, it's actually fairly annoying? A mismatch between silly Ned Flanders like performance and brutal violence or dialogue is only funny so many times before it gets old...And I don't know, in general this show is so cynical and mean sprited. It takes every opportunity to claim that wholesomeness or reciprocity is little more than a mask for selfishness. It makes sure to try and ""disillusion"" the viewers of the idea of ""good guys"" as nothing more than naivete but then it has cartoonishly evil ""bad guys"" who are greedy illuminati types that have nothing but selfish/bad intentions for their actions. If believing in fundamentally good guys is naive, then isn't believing in fundamentally bad guys? Because ultimately that's the same thing. It just shifts a good guy into meaning ""not as bad as the really bad guys"".The whole show mocks and insults the naivete of the vault dwellers and seems to suggest that their reciprocal ideal is old fashioned and just a cynical lie, but I don't buy that. I also don't think the story earns that as a conclusion, I think it contrives that conclusion. Lucy's story reminds me of the classic ""small town girl moves to the big city"" story. She's from this small, sheltered community and heads out to the ""real world"" and is forced to adapt and become less ""small town"" in order to make it. I think that's where this whole show's philosophy comes from. It's city dwellers who have internalized the ""only look out for yourself"" ethic as universal and then cynically insist that everyone secretly feels the same way deep down. And projecting that mentality onto an Apocalypse suggests that it's human nature to feel this way.But again, that feels like a contrivance. I'm certainly convinced that there's genuine value in those ethics that the show failed to confront, and that failure made it hard for me to get invested in Lucy's character turn because I didn't feel ""disillusioned"" along with her. I just felt like ""well they just decided to make everyone with that point of view a liar, that feels totally contrived. It doesn't prove or convince me of anything"".Perhaps you're an extremely cynical person. Or perhaps you're just not keen to interpret themes so intently. If you read it at merely a surface level, I could see enjoying it just for the jokes and the spectacle.Before the end of the review I must also point out the irony of the ""anti capitalist"" messaging in the show. Coming from Amazon of all places, that's totally rich.But yeah, not the worst show ever. Not by a long shot. In fact, it has many redeeming aspects. And depending on how deeply you intend to read into the story or your worldview this could be more or less enjoyable. I personally found the messaging to be a roadblock but I can see that hasn't been an issue for many others. But I am having a hard time understanding why other people seem to think it's well written as a narrative. I just don't find it to be engaging or emotionally effective. Lucy is the only character I care about and the rest feel like 1-2 dimensional cartoons and little more. The drama lacked drama, so to speak. But that's just how I felt.It's worth checking out regardless. If you're not sold by episode 3, then turn it off.",6
Fell out of story,"Watching all the great reviews, I thought this is finally a great series after a long time of mediocre US productions. I couldn't get past the first episode of the game adaptation ""Halo"", so I had hopes pinned up this would at least be somewhat better.I guess, this just wasn't for me. First five minutes of the series look really great and the graphics look awesome, but the story is pretty predictable. The acting could be way better. Some dialogues made me cringe. First meeting with her soon husband, she says ""What's your sperma count?"". On another occasion, ""They told me you were responsible"". ""Yes, they told me too"". And that's just in the first episode.Doesn't get better in the later ones either. Stopped it halfway through and it's not like, there are many episodes you have to endure this. Just 8, but it's super boring.",3
"Couldn't turn it off, can't wait for season 2!","Never played the game but love post apocalyptic thrillers, this one didn't disappoint.Walton Goggins is amazing. The whole cast really set this apart from other films and series of like genre.To say this didn't carry some sense of realism regarding the world we live in, would be a lie. A least as far as the vault tec conglomerate is concerned. It's not hard to watch the news and see these type of scenarios are common place in western society.Ella Purnell was intrinsic on screen and her character was all the more central because of her presence.Seriously can't wait for season 2 to come!",10
This was a rollercoaster of emotions.,"The decisions made in this show sometimes made me sick, but I understood. I took it to heart that: okay, maybe they have to make that decision, and I kept watching. And the ending made me salute my own decision.I have dived deep in the lore of Fallout, and the truth objectively is that the only games that stayed on the path for the entirety was 1, 2 and NV. Fallout 3 and 4 had more of a 50/50 split of staying on the path and bad retconning. But they are both great games I love, they just somewhat damaged the universe. I can live with that.This show has taken decisions that I sometimes have disliked. But the fact is that it is objectively great. No-matter how much I am biased to think my headcanon is better, the show stayed on the path, so I can't play that game.To be able to make a Fallout show this good makes it a 10 for me, however Robert Edwin House must play a part in season 2.Kudos to the writers/creators, exceptional job. And if anyone actually bothered to read this review. Don't get mad at the die-hard fans that are struggling to overcome their NCR being so viciously destroyed. Fallout was many youngsters start of thinking philosophically, it sure was mine. It took serious allocation of brainpower for me to understand.",10
"As a fan of the game franchise, I loved it","This show was so fun, engaging, and entertaining. I'm usually not one to binge TV shows because I get bored eventually but I found myself staying up way past my bedtime to finish an episode. I was actually shocked when I noticed each episode was about an hour long. Yes, the lore was different, but I think they made it work great. The cast was fantastic, as was the writing. I was skeptical at first since so many movies and shows based on game series and toys have been coming out, but the plot was excellent. Now, I really wish I'd paced myself because I can't wait to watch the next season! Would highly recommend!",10
Fun with a splash of mystery!,"9 ⭐What a fun series! Its really tough to make game adaptations but Jonathan Nolan, along with others, did a masterful job. Production and cinematography were all top notch. But what stood out the most for me was the casting and writing. Felt the cast really embodied the writing and understood where each character was coming from... especially walter goggins. I've always like him in westerns but he really stood out and did a superb job.I wish it was bit more PG-13ish (taking out the sexual content, wasnt needed anyway) just so i could watch this with my kids. Other than that...Cant wait for season 2!",9
Sits on the throne of great video game adaptations.,"Created by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner and its cast includes Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins, Kyle MacLachlan and Moises Arias.SynopsisBased on one of the most important video game sagas of all time, it is the story of the haves and the have-nots in a world where there is practically nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the peaceful inhabitants of the luxury lodges are forced to return to the irradiated hell left behind by their ancestors and are shocked to discover that an incredibly complex, joyfully strange and very violent universe awaits them.If The Last Us gave us some hope that video game adaptations would finally manage to be faithful to their origin, today Amazon Studios is present with its spectacular adaptation of the popular game Fallout. The studio takes all the laurels under the eaves of its two creators, Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, who faithfully and satisfactorily adapt this entire post-apocalyptic world that represents the complexity in which the entire story takes place after Fallout.A careful and well-thought-out work so as not to lose any of the blood that made the video game so popular, but also without forgetting that it is a television adaptation and that it must also capture a neutral audience. That work is done correctly where both fans of the game and viewers who connect with the story for the first time can enjoy a forceful, concise and well-written series, which makes you glued to the screen chapter after chapter without never lose the emotion of what we are seeing and the sensations that everything is increasing in satisfaction.The affection with which its creators take the series is essential for us to have a result that lives up to the satisfaction it generates. The dose with which they offer us humor, drama, war, survival and many more details in which the series surprises is a perfect cocktail to have a result that at times comes to surprise with its own ability to end up conquering known and unknown alike.Each chapter generates a successful journey through the action, social reflections and constant plot twists that in the hands of its inspired directors we obtain refined and notable entertainment from Amazon. The series is very intelligent when it comes to measuring each substance to be delivered so as not to exceed the formulas that end up turning the series into something meaningless. It is a series well measured in every detail and in each new option to be delivered, which means that it always remains even and never falters in pace, entertainment and emotion.A perfectly chosen cast where no one clashes and each one gives their stamp to their already popular characters. Having Walton Goggins with his Western attitude is the greatest possible pleasure, but also having a charming Ella Purnell as the great protagonist is also a delight, reflecting that her casting was totally a success in each of her performers.A series that clearly becomes one of the best so far in 2024 and without a doubt earns its place in the royalty of great video game adaptations to the small screen. Both the most fanatical and those looking for novelty will be totally pleased with a powerful proposal that makes use of their entire budget and their creative minds behind it. It is a series that you should see even if you do not know the game or are not a fan, because the series works from beginning to end with a forcefulness that does not give you room to doubt it at any moment and that is being faced with a great job that deserves to be appreciated by everyone.The Fallout universe is welcome to adaptation royalty.",8
Astonishing,"I think the series does a very good job at telling a completly new story without completly adapting the original game. The visuals come pretty close to it, which is great for long time fans of the bethesda game series. The Dialogje is great and the cast does a great job at putting life into the their animated respective charakters. I will definetly go onan rewatch it s soon as i'm done with writing this reviewing. One of the best orginial series of the year I can tell. I hope a second seaso. Will be announced soon and that they don't try to pull a TES6 on this one. Otherwise this would be very dissapointing.",10
Constant fade to black,"The transitions are awful. A fade to black every five minutes. It constantly hops back and forth between four main characters.The story invalidated every game. But as a fan fiction it represents the games well. If the games had hardly any enemies.Only three creatures were represented in this show and only a single one...
Everyone is either a bad actor or poorly directed, it's too nonserious, you never build emotion, tension and or any actual feeling.The CG is pretty rough and scaling isn't one to one with the games.A weak fallout plot, with daddy/abandonment and trust issues at the core of the writing.",6
Season 1 Review from Non-gamer (updated),"I have NOT played this video game, much to my partner's dismay and despite his obsession with it. Its concept intrigues me, but I'm just not much of a gamer. I knew my partner was awaiting the release of this series with keen interest, and judging by the trailers I'd seen, it looked like the kind of show I'd enjoy. My only concern was if I'd be unable to appreciate it since I haven't played the game. I'm writing this for any others out there who haven't played the game but are considering checking out the show.My husband did pause the first episode at least twice to brief me on the overall timeline concept (which I do have a slight issue with.... Hard to believe that clothing, furniture and home decor wouldn't have evolved. Not to mention other fields of science... but Okey Dokey) and later the ghouls/mutants. Had he not filled me in on those items, I'm sure I could've still watched the episode through to the end without feeling too bewildered. It's also easy enough to look up some basics on the game's universe if you feel like you need to prepare beforehand.What I loved:
Quick paced, sleek look, well edited, solid cast and acting, lots of action, plenty of suspense and intrigue, and a sprinkle of wry humor. The first episode introduces us to the three major characters and three vastly different settings within the story's universe. Is compelling and very well done. As the season progresses, the show gets better every episode and leaves you wanting more! It's gripping, smart, fun, thrilling, and totally binge worthy. If you are a fan of shows in the genre of post-apocalyptic settings, alternate timelines, zombies, sci fi, action, you should definitely give it a try; it lives up to the hype.And for those who have played the game, my husband said loved the show, and that there were plenty of Easter Eggs in it to appease him as a Fallout gamer fanboy. 😊",9
"Very decent, but over the top adoration","Never having heard of the game Fallout, I came into this blind and had no idea what to expect.I have to say I enjoyed the series and would like to see a series 2, but I really don't get reviews of 8 or higher.Are people seriously suggesting this series is better than the Godfather or Shawshank? Of course it isn't. I appreciate it's a series and not a film, but ratings take account of the same aspects.Acting is decent, and some characters are likeable, but not many to be honest.I feel the story is stretched out and could probably have been done and dusted in 4 episodes.Good but no Oscar winner.",7
"Horrible story, Great portrayal of the world","I love the games and the Fallout universe, but from a story and character perspective, this was terrible. I found myself disinterested whenever the two main characters weren't on screen. Maximum, in particular, was unbearable without the others. I'm eager for a fan edit that removes this character and most of the ghouls' backstory, which was mostly pointless.Fallout has explored Vault-Tec's history in many other ways that didn't just spoon-feed us information and instead allowed us to piece things together. This approach felt like poor planning or storytelling.While it was great to see the world, the locations seemed to be taken directly from the games with nothing new.In short, it's a lot of fan service and not much else.",3
Way better than expected,"To be honest, i was not expecting much, but maybe because of that, i found it to be very good. Acting is above average, story is fine and there are so many elements reproduced near accuratelly from the game: monsters, weapons, terminals, basically...all.There is dark humour, enough horror scenes, and quite a complex environment with characters and places.There are some episodes that lack substance, but overall, it is a successfull first season. I just hope they will keep it like that with the future one(s) also.I would like and hope that they will add more action to it (just a personal wish).Waiting for next season.",9
Started in 1997,"I've been a fan of the Fallout franchise right from it's early days in 1997. I have played every single game, some of them even multiple times. I've even prepared meals from the recipes that came as a gimmick within the Fallout 1 manual. I literally grew up with the world of Fallout, thus I consider myself a true Fallout nerd.With all of that being said I cannot express how glad I am that what I've witnessed with this cinematic implementation is (with some mistakes which I consider to be forgiveable) an absolute perfect fit. The mood of the games, the humour, the sarcasm, the criticism about our society, the splatter and all the little details make this a must watch for everyone. Surely you can argue that not everything is golden but overall this season 1 is never letting you off the hook, feeding you new information, keeping the tension and suprising you with plot twists over and over again.I can't wait for the second season letting us delve into the next chapter. More Please!!!",10
Greatness achieved with minor trepidations,"THE BAD:
The Brotherhood of Steel is both strongly MALE and FEMALE, NOT just male and NOT male CHAUVINIST like the film portrays. All of the VIDEO GAMES present strong female leaders or characters in the Brotherhood of Steel. And there are SISTERS too in the games!Although I agree with the story arc of Maximus; as it's logical and as good as the other 2 main characters, the leadership plot-line with the BOS is confusing/forced and not sure why certain major moments happen in it.I think the BOS should have focused more on the risks Maximus took out in the field.Next, the last EPISODE 8 is rushed with way too many plot-lines trying to find extension or closer. It gets muddled and melodramatic.THE GREAT:
You cannot deny the amazing acting and characterization of the 3 main characters in Fallout TV show.THE COWBOY, a super cowboy renegade with the most hilariously conceived western accent and aphorisms in any movie since Tombstone. Give Goggins a Grammy please! I was waiting for an ""I'll be you Huckleberry!!"" He rivals Val Kilmer! He also plays 3 Americana roles. The Cowboy and the Salesman, as well as the gigging grinding Freelancer.THE VAULT DWELLER: A cute, plucky and naive American portrayed by the oddly enough British actress Ella Purnell. A mirror reflection from Britain that I think we really needed. She plays the role sublimely, and hilarious and cute all the way through. Since she gained combat experience and it seems endurance with some bizarre form of Charisma in the vault, you are either waiting for her to kick some ass and get things done, or take an injury all the way through with blissful anxiety.BROTHER MAXIMUS: Aaron Moten I love this actor. Great portrayal with a slice of comedy intermixed. He's a major force within the show of sympathy, contradictions and self learning that he experiences along the way. Again the writers made him very individual like the other two. All characters in the show seem to have multiple choices at their disposal so we are learning along the way to how they want to proceed.ALL THE OTHER CHARACTERS: The ""NPCS"" all of them are just amazing as in the video games. Especially Dale Dickey with the ""Your kind ain't welcome around here"" classic western line but all gussied up, and her cackling and manic laughing. Give her a Grammy as well. And give the CASTING DIRECTOR an award too while you're at it.Also the sets are absolutely stunning and real while also the film was filmed with Kodak film adding another layer of realism with celuloide's infinite resolution and saturation.This movie is high grade Americana in its' purist most capitalist, socialist cult and wildly adventurist form! It kind of emphasizes that in America, there really is no definition as to what it can become.",9
A Masterclass in Video Game Adaptations,"As someone who's played Fallout for well over a decade, all the way from Fallout 3 to New Vegas, 4, and even 76, this show right here is a blueprint, a framework, an absolute lesson in how to accurately portray a video game into a live action environment. Where others like Halo and Witcher have failed, Fallout succeeds and then some.I was first thrown off by the way it was telling the story, with different perspectives from Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul - really reminded me a lot of how Witcher first started out and I was really worried that that's how it was going to go down. But, as the story progressed and the perspectives started to converge on one another, where Lucy meets the Ghoul and Maximus at the same time - I quickly realized that it wasn't like the Witcher at all and the different character personalities and traits felt very much like characters out of the Fallout show.Each episode was gripping, told a different side of the overall story, and had all of these neat little subplots that helped advance the plot along in a positive way. I personally really enjoyed the Super Duper Mart episode because it felt like a side quest straight out of Fallout 3 or 4.The characters were all just downright amazing too. Of course, my personal favorite was The Ghoul - Walton Goggins just stole every scene he was in and his acting was just as good, if not better than his work in Justified. Such a criminally underrated actor. Ella Purnell's Lucy and Aaron Moten's Maxmius were amazing protagonists and they both fit the mold for the backgrounds they were supposed to represent in the story.The end scene was the chef's kiss to the whole show and opened up the whole story to a whole new medium of the Fallout show. I hope and pray that S2 will be even better than S1 and that it doesn't devolve into something the fans don't want - much like how we saw in Halo and Witcher.If you have Prime and are thinking of watching the show, wait no longer, do it now and you won't regret it (I hope)!",10
Awesome show!,"Wow!!! I loved this show! I didn't know what to expect because I never played the game but it was awesome! So unexpected! It was so funny, fun, and with action and gore! The actors are likable and perfect for the show! I cannot wait to watch more! Written well and so much fun to watch! This makes me want to play the video game! I totally want to rewatch this show again! The show is probably not for everyone but if you enjoyed watching the trailer you will love the show! The concept of the show is surprisingly good and makes you think! It also has shocking surprises. Check it out! If you don't like it that's your problem! Enjoy!",10
Pleasantly awaiting season 2,"As a big fan of Fallout 4 (less a fan of 76), and the lore of the games, I started the show and was somewhat disappointed. The few first episodes did not really feel like ""Fallout"", but as I got more and more into it it became better and better.I watched all the episodes in the spawn of two days, I was glued to the screen after I survived the first episodes.They did a mighty fine job of staying (mostly) true to the Fallout series while still making it their own show, it does not feel exactly as the games felt, but I believe it's as close as it could possibly be to the source material without being a complete ripoff.A few bits and pieces felt lackluster, like where is the workbench, which I at least used every time I played Fallout 4. There were also a few more things, but I won't mention it as I don't wanna give out any spoilers.I do feel like The Last Of Us the show did a bit of a better job at adapting the game into a show, but of course they chose to stay closer to the source material than Fallout the show.Fallout 4 is one of my favorite games, and as far as this show goes it keeps me eagerly awaiting the next season, I will definitely be along for the ride.",10
Good Adaptation that Mishandles Some Important Lore,"As someone who has spent countless hours across all the Fallout games, I was very nervous when they announced this project. Videogame adaptations tend to be extremely disrespectful to their source material and try to do their own thing which, almost all of the time, turns out for the worse. So I am very thankful that the Fallout show carefully crafts its original narrative with proper admiration for the source material. Being canon does hurt the overall lore, and depending on how much you liked the stuff it poorly handles, you might loathe the show.The show opens with Cooper Howard, with this one short scene done right before the bombs fell and destroyed the world, it's a very effective scene that gets you invested early on. Right after that they have a short scene introducing Lucy which is a nod to all the skills of the series. A bit after that, they show different vault dwellers interacting, I won't disclose much here as these interactions show how different the residents of every vault can be, which is another thing nicely adapted from the games. I do find the marriage subplot of the opening to be a bit too cringe-worthy for my taste, but hey it is something that feels straight out of Fallout 2. Lastly, they introduce the brotherhood character of the show, Maximus, and they do a really good job with him as well. I think fans of Fallout 1, 2, and 3 would really dig Lucy as the lead. I, myself do find her good but her ""romantic"" side only comes across as cringey to me, plus as much as they try to make her a multi-dimensional character, she remains very plain throughout the story.The production quality always looked immaculate, I was just nervous that they would mess up the narrative, and my concerns only got bigger when we found out that the show was going to be canon to the games. The casting is well done and plenty of the characters, just like the sets in the show, ooze that good old fallout feel; the visuals are the stars of the show for me, It just looks completely immersive and top-notch, they have so many tiny details right, it's unbelievable at times that such care was put into it and, once again, it is, by far, the best aspect of the show.Naturally, the show can't put every single great thing about Fallout in one season but it does a decent enough job and treats the source material with utmost respect while telling its own story in this universe. Once again, I just wish they didn't mishandle what they did, as these are some of the most essential aspects of the games. This show has plenty of potential, so, I hope this keeps improving as we get more and more seasons.Furthermore, the story has some clear pacing issues, and the characters aren't that great either, but it all ends very fittingly and if they can straighten these few sore bumps then we might have an incredible show on our hands by season 2. How it all comes together in the end is quite well done, I wish it happened sooner though, as for most of the show there is no captivating main driving force, the initial ones only work for the first 4 episodes. The writers could've just had Lucy meet some more intriguing characters throughout her journey this could've fleshed out her character far more and kept the overall show far more engaging than it is.Moreover, I believe people will like all three leads, Lucy is a good character who serves as a decent character for the slow introduction of the series to those who have never touched a Fallout game. The Ghoul, Cooper Howard, is a very morally corrupt character who leads most of the action sequences of the show. The Brotherhood newbie, Maximus is also a very likable addition; weirdly enough, to me, he comes across as Finn from Star Wars but is better written. This will bring in so many new fans and I am very much looking forward to their impressions on the games.",7
Excellent show from a copilot's POV,"I am not a player, but I watch my husband play & ""co-pilot"" & cheerlead for him. I watch the surroundings & let him know if there's loot, enemies coming, etc. Hundreds of hours. I even have my own collections in every settlement he builds. (And an island full of gorillas). This show is just like that. It's so much fun! The story line, the humor, the atmosphere, the scenery, the JUNK GUN! Pure pleasure!! I love that they didn't hold back on the adult humor in an attempt to gain a larger audience. I love all the questions it opened up in the lore. I can't wait to see what happened in season two.",10
"Pretty good, especially for gamers","This Prime adaptation of Bethesda's hugely successful game series does a surprisingly good job of both being a decent watch in it's own right, and of bringing the games to life.Fallout was a well-chosen title to adapt: it's enormously rich in story, creativity, humour and atmosphere throughout. It's utterly immersive and full of fabulous, convincing characters and places.The story begins in the claustrophobic confines of Vault 33, home to what's left of the human race in a post-apocalyptic world. And they're a surprisingly cheerful and phelgmatic bunch. Until circumstances oblige our heroine, Lucy, to leave the safe familiarity of the Vault and go exploring the unknown Wastelands above. And then all hell breaks loose.If you have played the games, the look, tone, sounds and details will take you right back there, and there's very little to complain about. Many of the scenes, costumes, and characters will be delightfully familiar.But is it great TV? Well, yes and no.I really enjoyed Fallout, and honestly I think there is much to like about it. And it's clear that some people who haven't played the game, and indeed might not normally be fans of this genre, enjoyed it too - see the review by the usually hard-to-please Lucy Mangan in The Gurdian, for example.However, personally I'm not convinced that it would be easy to 'get it' if you come to this cold.What do I mean by that? Well, solidly delivered emotional or action scenes will frequently be punctuated by moments of very cheesy humour that could feel awkward, but again are true to the source material. The cheesiness is also quite effective relief from the very graphic (if cartoon-like) violence and horror.Similarly, some of the sets and studio lighting really look like something straight out of 1970s TV (cardboard rocks and painted backdrops). But so what? It's a game adaptation - it's allowed to look slightly unreal, and even that production style feels deliberately chosen to add to the retro kitsch vibe.Meanwhile, many of the characters are just great - Walton Goggins' The Ghoul chief among them, with honourable mentions to Sarita Choudhary as Moldava and Michael Emerson as Wilzig (aka The Head).Elia Purnell does a fine and charming job of carrying the lead as Lucy MacLean, and it's great to see Kyle MacLachlan appearing as her father - again a welcome throwback to worthy forebearers of this show including Twin Peaks and Dune (you know, the other one). But yes, criticism of Aaron Moten's turn as Maximus is probably fair - his range of emotions seem broader when he's in the T60 suit than when he's out of it.Give it a go, you might like it. If you played the game, I reckon it's a 9/10. If not, it's still fun if you go with the flow. And if you don't like it, well it's not the end of the world...",7
Stop falling for it and they'll stop tricking you,"The only reason studios have resorted to making nonstop remakes of original properties is because you keep watching them and thinking they're good. You see the creativity of the original showing through without understanding that the people who made the show had absolutely nothing to do with that aspect, and they only can take credit for the bad parts of the show like the lazy and stupid writing, the nonsense plot holes, the actors who don't really know anything about the source material and are just following a poorly written script, and pretty much everything else about the show that you can overlook if the show ""looks"" right. The sad part is the people who were responsible for the design, the characters, setting, and overall story have nothing to do with the show- they just receive a check in exchange for allowing corporate executives to butcher their work. It doesn't matter if the lead character is cute and likable and they have little nuka cola caps on the cover. Any idiot can watch a video essay about the fallout games and drain a multimillion dollar budget to make something that looks ""true to the source material"". It's just a trick the studios are playing on audiences so they won't notice that nothing they create is an original story anymore. Fallout, last of us, euphoria, game of thrones, the boys- every tv show nowadays is just a remake of something that already existed. There is no originality in our shows or movies anymore. That will only stop if you, the viewer, stop feeding into it. All the glowing 10 star reviews for this lazy garbage all say the same thing- don't listen to the fans. That should tell you all you need to know.",1
surprisingly enjoyable,"I never played the game, but when i saw a trailer of this series my attention was caught. For me it's a mix of Star Wars, The Last of Us, Alien and The Walking Dead. Sure the storyline is pretty straight on, with no difficult timelines or whatever (like 'Dark' or '1899'). But boy it's entertaining and somehow it's keeps you hooked. The visuals are great, acting it pretty good and the story never gets slow. Lucy is a likable main character, not to strong and with human naiveties.You can sense it's a game adaption with all the hardcore action and arcade / over the top shootings, but not in a way your'e looking at a B movie or something.",8
This was awesome!,"The game Fallout has been playing since 1997 and has an extremely large crowd of fans in the meantime. Since 2007, Fallout's rights have been sold to Bethesda, with 4 games added to the shelves and a number of additions to them. Anyone who knows the games will have labeled this a bit as fairly unfilmable. Still, Jonathan Nolan, yes Christopher Nolan's 6 years younger brother, wanted to burn his hands on the Fallout project. Jonathan is only more adept at the writers' part and whoever looks at his CV sees that he hardly has anything to his name as a director. The series takes place within the same continuity as the video game franchise, but has become an original story of its own. Executive producer Todd Howard said he wanted to prevent the video games from being tweaked.Especially people who are not familiar with the Fallout franchise will really have to get used to the weird setting for the first two episodes. The atmosphere in the series is very strong and lives up to the game, but the luguber humor and the completely strange things that happen will make the eyebrows frown for a while. Precisely because the world of Fallout is so atmospheric and well portrayed, this series has perhaps become one of the best game adaptations ever, at least, that's what I think. From the third episode, the whole thing starts to get a bit more structure and you will also understand where the whole thing wants to go in the end. You actually skip between several lines in the story. For example, there is the story of Lucy, who goes through the desert together with Ghoul Cooper, Maximus who ends up in a bizarre situation as a turtle of Knight Titus and of course how Vault 33 wants to pick up the thread again, but does not know how to deal with their captured killers. But in order to fully understand the big picture, we have to go back to the beginning and that's exactly where Fallout works.In episode 6, structure begins to come into the series and it becomes clear where the big picture wants to go. Every storyline remains equally interesting and the absurdism is only increasing. But exactly how everything is put together remains unclear until the last episode and we also have to go back to the whole beginning. Fortunately, for the rest, it doesn't matter whether you have played the games or not, the series may then connect with the world of Fallout and constantly hint to things from the games, yet the series follows its own path and prior knowledge is absolutely not required. Everything is just well worked out and it reminded me from time to time to time the books of The Dark Tower by Stephen King, which I would like to see filmed in this way and I'm not talking about that halfgare film from 2017. Fallout is just surprisingly good and brings this to the man with a lot of gore and weird humor. After the 8 episodes, you're still looking for a second season.Fallout - Season 1 is perhaps the best movie of a game ever. Prior knowledge is absolutely not necessary, because although the story takes place in the world fan of the games, it completely follows its own path. As a neutral viewer, you will still have something about the first two episodes of what are you actually looking at, but after that the story starts to take shape. With 8 episodes ranging from playing time from 45 minutes to an hour, it looks away wonderfully and quickly. One must have a strong stomach, by the way, because some scenes are in no way inferior to a spicy horror film, so this is definitely not suitable for young viewers. Eventually when the end has come you will crave for more, but it will be a while for a second season and although nothing is known about that yet, it is quite a certainty that it will really come.",9
Fallout: What Happened in the Last 200 Years?,"Fallout, the popular post-apocalyptic video game series that has been on the consoles of game lovers for years since its release in 1997, was brought to the screens this year by Amazon Studios. In the director's chair are names such as Jonathan Nolan, whom we know from Westworld, and Clare Kilner, who we know from her work in House of the Dragon. Therefore, it would not be wrong to say that the series has created great expectations. Judging by the comments received immediately after its release, both fans and new viewers are very pleased with the product. We can thank Prime Video for releasing all the episodes at the same time instead of spreading them over weeks and allowing us to watch them uninterruptedly, and move on to why the series is so good.If we take a look at the story for those who are not aware of the games, we witness how a civilization that was destroyed as a result of the nuclear bomb attack on America in 2077 was established 200 years later. Colonies that we are familiar with from most post-apocalyptic movies/series are also included here. One of these colonies is the formations called Shelters, which were created for the survival of civilians due to the danger of Sino-US nuclear war. Our journey begins when our main character, Lucy, a resident of the Shelter who only reads about life in books, descends into the outside world.We also get to know many different groups during this journey. Technological soldiers, which are indispensable in apocalyptic science fiction, are handled here under the name of the Brotherhood of Steel. During our journey, we also meet Ghouls, a mutated human type that is one of the building blocks of Fallout games. In fact, the three main characters we see are representations of these groups. Although there are many theories within the groups in the Fallout universe, the backgrounds and goals of these characters are written quite successfully.It is also worth saying that the world built in the series has its own style. Although a nostalgic ""American Dream"" picture is drawn in terms of songs, radio programs, clothes, in short, culture, a retro-futuristic atmosphere has been achieved with the use of artificial intelligence and robots. Especially the music choices from the 1960s in the action scenes and the fact that we watch most of the scenes in slow motion make it very enjoyable to watch despite the blood and brutality. We can say that our director Nolan, who is already a fan of video games, thought about every detail while bringing the universe to the screen. Costume designs are also part of this. By the way, we should not mention the name of Amy Westcott, the costume designer of the series. Because the costumes are all handmade. Yes, even the armor of the Brotherhood of Steel armies. While the uniform uniforms we see in the Sanctuary and the Brotherhood of Steel reflect discipline and the existence of rules, with an almost school atmosphere, the very punk styles of those in the outside world allow us to visually dominate this universe where partisanship arises.After giving our spoiler warning for the rest of the article, we can go into a little more detail about the series. We follow a plot connected to three main characters. Our beginning is when Lucy goes to the outside world to find her kidnapped father. The motto of the post-apocalyptic Pollyanna Lucy character, ""We will make America a better place,"" of course fades away as she stays in the outside world, that is, the real world. At this point, the producers did not set out with the concern of not being political and placed sociological criticisms into the story in a very appropriate and humorous manner. Ella Purnell, who brings our character to life, talks about how exciting it is to handle the journey of such a naive and privileged person in the real world, as if she were a newborn baby. At the same time, the character of Lucy was written specifically for the series. Even though we witnessed their naivety and strange reactions at the moment of crisis, we say it is a good thing that it was written because it is one of the characters that increases our sympathy for the series.In the development part, we are welcomed by Maximus, our new Knight of the Brotherhood of Steel, and our anti-hero Cooper Howard (The Ghoul), who makes us feel the suspicion of ""There is something up with this"" in every move he makes, and whose charisma does not take away from his lack of a nose. Cooper Howard is shown in parts in the series as past and present, but in the last two episodes we see that it constitutes a very important part of the story and even itself. There is an interesting surprise about this character in the series. In the part where the character gives his number so that they can contact the Refuge phones, if you actually dial the number, you can hear the cries of someone being tortured for help. Now you know which number to dial to escape boring meetings.Although the Brotherhood of Steel is a technologically advanced group, it is certain that not much goes into their huge armor. They are a community that is very committed to its own truths and, to put it bluntly, a bigoted community. This group of soldiers in particular was the one with the most connection to our world. Because what we see in the Brotherhood of Steel is nothing more than a nationalist army of soldiers. It seems that the bullying among the ranks, which we also see in American culture, will not lose its effect even after centuries have passed. Revenge, ambition and conscience, which are indispensable concepts when dealing with a war issue, are especially woven into Maximus' story.The fact that the series received so much acclaim when it was first released brings with it comparisons. One of those series is The Last of Us, which has been talked about for a long time since its release. Although they are similar because they are adapted from a post-apocalyptic video game, I think they are in very different leagues due to the difference in how they operate. While The Last of Us is in a darker and drama-heavy universe, Fallout's relatively cynical atmosphere clearly separates the two.The only point I was stuck on was that I strongly felt that the series was a video game adaptation, even though the producers intended the opposite. Although seemingly unrelated events were connected to each other towards the end without leaving any question marks in mind, they tired me a little at first. Still, we consumed it as a holiday treat, and it is a perfect recommendation for those looking for a TV series to binge-watch.",8
First review for a great show,"I never written a review but had to for this show since I would be considered an ""OG"" of the Game series . I've been waiting years and years for a show and we finally got one . I'm stoked for season 2 seeing new Vegas gave me a rush . What can we expect to see . The House ? The boomers ? Caesars legion ? Great khans ? The kings ? Id like to see the institute or Railroad eventually but thats whats great about this series . The possibilities are endless . The FO series is set up with tide turning action and drama situations but also has great corky weird scenarios and characters to give it that missing ingredient of dark humor and Comedy in general . Love how you are all bringing the wasteland to life .i love how they follow a few different characters. Continue to raise the bar and drop jaws . Hopefully we begin to see more games being adapted into shows and movies . It's kinda what every gamer who wants more of a game/genre wishes for. Looking forward to seeing Fallout merch and Games/game apps being available also .theres no way you can miss . This right here is pure gold you struck.",8
Surprisingly impressed.,"I took the time to write a review, which is something I typically wouldn't do. However, this show is so good, I actually care to to you it is. I've played hours of every fallout game until my eyes would figuratively bleed from so much exposure.My point is, IMO, a majority of video games which were either made into movies or TV shows turned out to be terrible. No presentation, captive story telling, acceptable acting, etc. This show is an exception. It has the ability to draw first-time players to the game, and also, fills long-time gamers with joy. I highly recommend to both audiences. I was surprisingly impressed.I wouldn't be surprised if the success of this show brought us Fallout 5 sooner than later.",9
A Great Western,"Fallout may be the surprise hit of the year so far. I have only played Fallout 4 (and absolutely loved it) and have knowledge of the rest. I tend not to like what Amazon does outside of a few things here and there. This show has taken over pop culture right now and that is honestly quite surprising given video game movies and shows never seem to land.The show is well acted, well paced and they truly put he money into it to do the story justice. The set designs are great, the music is fantastic. It has many nods to classic westerns and the 3 main story lines the show follows all feel like they could be their own quality movie.My only even possible complaints are fairly minor. The story features so much plot armor it causes the show to feel downright hoaky and corny at a lot of times. It also struggles to find a tone, I think the games find a perfect mix of comedy and despair where the show leans way more into despair across the board.Overall Fallout does it's legendary source material proud and I for one and excited for Season 2!",8
HALO lite,"First things out of the way, the first episode was a hot mess but the show quickly recovered and pushed out a decent season. I did not like the opener at all, as major part of the fallout games experience was the whole life inside the vault. Here all that is done horribly, rushed out and we are kicked down the road as quickly as they can film it. There's also too many incomplete flashbacks, random events and all over the place jumping in that one episode. As far as pilots go, this is one of the worst i've seen in a while. However, as i said, they quickly move on from that and the rest of the episodes are fine.Why do i call it halo lite.. well, because throughout the whole season it reminded me of halo in so many ways. Contrary to the games they went for military adaptation over survival, shoving the armor of the brotherhood to the center. The lone protagonist (player) in the wasteland that the games are focused on is not a thing here. The series world is all about faction vs faction instead of vault dweller vs the unknown. Support characters are irrelevant and meaningless beyond their singular use followed by death or removal from screen time.The series goes straight into chasing some item making it the focal purpose of the season, just like in halo you are chasing the artifacts. All the elements that halo show revolved around, so does fallout. Corruption, conspiracies, secret motives, etc etc. At the same time, we know the games are not the same at all. Yet the shows are basically very close to each other.Where they differ is in that FALLOUT tries to be light; they go for the comedic here and there and not all doom and gloom serious business every scene. I am not sure i am a fan of this. Fallout is not a parody and beyond the comedic contrast of the vault with the outside, the world is not like we see here. They removed the doom and gloom and we have some censored washed up zombie series where characters are overly quirky and downright stupid. Some scenes feel straight out of IDIOCRACY to the point i had to look up the cast to see if they are the same people... Fallout obviously samples other shows and we cannot get around that. It's beyond obvious at times. MAD MAX still has the best wasteland characters with the most logical behavior for the setting. Even WATERWORLD uses more sense in building screen extras. Just for extra convincing, LOST makes a cameo with Ben Linus reprising his lost character in fallout. I mean this down to his manners, speech, looks; everything. Nice easter egg honestly but also come on guys, be original! Still, seeing Linus again after all this years felt good. I wonder if the island survived the nuclear fallout.... since the timeframe of dharma corp on the island does fit the period of fallout flashback scenes.. Homage is sometimes underappreciated but not always relevant.Simply stated the show is not realistic. We see a bunch of specifically shown injuries and i can tell you from personal experience, you are not trekking across the desert with those injuries. The pain alone would be unbearable. The pain of utilizing those damaged body parts, would be unfathomable. Let's just ignore attempts that this is serious in any way and focus around what they went for.Their goal was to make something fun based on a stylized version of the game. It feels like it with all the forced naivety and sanitized wasteland. The only reason the show didn't burn was because it is fun. It is not dull and you want to keep watching just to see. It is not perfect and its overall rating on here is just absolutely inflated, but for all the runtime they do a decent job keeping it together. There are plot holes, there are odd choices made and one must never forget this is not serious science fiction. If one does not dissect it apart it works. Yet if you begin to nitpick it has lots of things wrong with it. Fortunately what it has is good enough and entertaining enough.7\10 master chief of the spartans, meet knight maximus of the brotherhood.",7
A video game come to life,"First of all, I want to apologize for my English. Here's my opinion on Fallout.While Fallout might not be everyone's cup of tea due to some gritty scenes, it's hands down one of the best productions in recent years. Sure, there are some nitpicks, like the forced character encounters at times, but there's no denying it's a stellar adaptation of the gaming world crafted by Bethesda. The attention to detail, coupled with top-notch production and a cast that nails it, makes this series a current phenomenon. Highly recommended if you've got the stomach for it.I hope the second season of the Fallout series, which has already been confirmed, lives up to the first and doesn't disappoint.",9
Watchable,"It's ok. Not great, but watchable. Considering it came from the maker of the abomination Rings of Poop, I was expecting it would be horrid. And Amazon made the garbage Wheel of Time show too. Amazon has a history of ruining established IPs. But Fallout was passable. The story was typical for the setting; anyone familiar with Fallout would recognize the standard plot. The characters were acceptable. I thought Ella Purnell was decent in the lead role and she wasn't a total girl boss. At least they tried to explain her combat skills. Her performance was a little flat at times, but passable. Aaron Moten was decent. I liked his character's arc, but his performance was sometimes unconvincing. Like Purnell it was a little flat. I wonder if this was more about directing than acting. Walton Goggins was excellent as The Ghoul, definitely the best character in the show. I'm a fan of Michael Emerson and would have liked to have seen more of his character. More Dogmeat please! None of the characters made me want to stick a fork in my eye when they came on screen, which was refreshing for modern ""entertainment."" There was a little identity politics sprinkled in, but minimal compared to most movies/shows and it did not distract from the story. I probably would not have noticed it if not for the in your face saturation that happens in most shows these days. The ending was weak and really drawn out. Showing something slowly doesn't make it more meaningful. It was ok, but not great.",7
"Could have been great, settled for less","I never played the games, so I'm watching this as objectively as I can and keeping an open mind. After watching most of the episodes, I have some mixed thoughts. There are some excellent moments that build tension and drama very well. Then there are moments that seem completely out of place. These great moments convey a graveness and severity that is almost always broken by some ill thought out joke or plot point. If you do it once unexpectedly or set it up well, it can be funny. Doing it poorly over and over just makes it seem odd and breaks the viewer's engagement.The show will put in the time to build up a critical situation, they'll show a very violent gore filled scene and then cap it off in a shallow attempt at comedy. If it was written better, it would probably have worked, but it comes off as haphazard and awkward too often. It's almost as if the writers or showrunners don't want the show to be taken too seriously or become too frightening for the audience, which is strange for a post apocalyptic drama. It also lacks consistent quality writing, flow and consistently engaging plot points that would allow it to take comedic liberties.There are some great elements. Some characters (Ghoul, Wilzig and the elder) and plot arcs are interesting. They will show a great scene then lose the momentum they just built by shifting to others that are poorly done. It is so strange to have these amazing visuals only to then be awkwardly interrupted by unnecessary moments or a weird soundtrack that is out of place. The raid in the first episode leaves so many unanswered questions and just seems so implausible and forced. The character take so many actions that don't make any sense. The 10/10 reviewers don't have any issues with the plot or show at all???The characters don't seem to question these strange inconsistencies either. Even when they do, the other characters have no answers and so they just move on as if it never happened! This is another symptom of lazy writing. I understand that they are trying to keep some mystery while building the plot, but ultimately there is too much that is glossed over or is missing entirely. There are good moments and the writing can be good but there are always a few moments every episode that leave me shaking my head. It's a shame that there is so much going for this show but the writers just keep falling short.",5
Really good game adaptation,"I am really glad that this adaptation wasn't ruined.I am a big fan of the games, and it brings me joy to see it go through.It is slow in the beginning with the world building stories, therefore for someone who comes from the game with knowledge about the world it can get boring.But it is done right. And after ep.4 I was sucked in and binge watched until the end.There are some inconsistencies, but they are easy to overlook for regular audience which is the target audience. But there are easter eggs and mentions for us folks.Acting is good, most of the times.Line up is perfect, as far as I am concerned and very well picked.Gore and action aren't over the top and blends in with the theme.Story is intriguing and captivating, and makes you crave more.They did a really good job with costumes and CGI which are good and in place.All in all, solid 9 and I can't wait to see the next season.",9
Superb TV,"After feeling that streaming had past it's halcyon days for a while now different platforms have blown me away over the last couple of weeks.Ripley was a superb retelling of a book I love and now this drops straight after.I've never seen or played the game, am aware of some of the imagery but not any characters or narrative. So for me, this has to stand alone and I have no idea if it is true to the source.However, who cares? I know it's popular to moan about things not respecting source material but if it's this good, can't we just enjoy it?The best bit for me is the overarching narrative of big business taking control of governments. Feel relevant?The main characters are well established and brilliantly played. With some of the side characters feeling a little underdone.The story was defined and well executed with just enough tension and confusing to keep me guessing.Decent dialogue, dark and sometimes childlike humour work together with superb production values and direction.It's funny, weird, engaging and in some places brilliantly gory.Is streaming getting its mojo back?",9
Brilliance - stunning TV version of the Fallout game series.,"OK so I'm not a gamer but I have always liked the look and lore of Fallout, especially Fallout 4. Follow an inhabitant of the nuclear fallout shelter 33 as she goes on a quest outside and encounters sights and lifeforms of extreme diversity. The sandy complex post nuclear holocaust world is far more complex and nuanced than regular post nuke films and the show switches between the past and present to flesh out the characters and plot. Expect surprises - extreme gore, sci-fi stuff, wild plot reveals. On a par with the first season of Westworld and with a great cast this is a rare gem among recent TV.",10
Best series ever and best game adaption ever they knocked it out of the park,"Everything about this series Is perfect fallout down to the cast to cinematography writing casting characters everything director etc everyone who worked on this huge props to you every episode has you hooked wnating more each episode ones you see one you can't get enough and wanting more been missing this in a show for a long time Walton Goggins character he's an incredible and lucy, maximus and I am excited for season 2 warning heavy spoilers read at your own risk the fact that they are adapting fallout new vegas my favourite and best fallout ever made im so hyped to see future of this show.",10
One for the Conspiracy Theorists,"I started watching this show because I was curious about the game - which I've never played - and also because it has a good rating.Well, the first season is done and I finished watching it in two days. It's that interesting. The plot twists and story keep you hooked from the get-go, and the character arcs keep you guessing what our heroes will do next.For example, ""the ghoul"" starts off as a cool dude, then does some shady ""surfies"" stuff, and then slowly becomes an anti-hero figure. Of all the characters, he is probably my favorite because of his complete lack of correctness.There is a romantic side to the story, which I don't much care for, but I guess you can't have your cake and eat it, too.Definitely looking forward to season 2. And yes, I do recommend watching this if you like sci-fi with a healthy serving of bloodshed.",9
Just.. Okay.,"Two big points that I have to say, CGI and story line are mediocre at best. There are a couple of scenes where you find yourself saying ""damn!"" and laughing at some obviously inserted humor, but there are SO many plot holes, completely unnecessary plot points, and some characters have plot armor that is so thick that it's just silly (bulletproof and luckier than a four leafed-rabbit's foot) Unfortunately, if you ARE a fan of the franchise you will be so confused at what is actually happening in the show, all while trying to piece together all of the lore that they casually sprinkle into the show. It's cool to see Fallout on the big screen, with great props and decent enough casting, but it's just.. ehh. If you've never played the games and you're looking to binge something then I am sure you will enjoy the show, but anybody with a familiarity of the game will most likely be disappointed.",
Sometimes amazing. Sometimes Horrible.,"-2 Acting is sometimes great, but the contrast between the great acting and amateurs in this is a bit too much sometimes, especially with the Maximus character, his acting is pretty bad and his friend in training camp also bad, when they interact with the good actors it is jarring and sometimes I just need to skip ahead it is so bad and cringeworthy.-1 Direction is okay, not amazing. Some parts are 3 second shots 3 seconds shots, 3 second shots and it is TikTok monkey brain, some long shots are poorly done, flat feel like a green screen sci-fi channel. Pacing is a bit too slow sometimes, and a bit too fast at times.-1 for DEI and THE MESSAGE bs in this, how can you have a world of strong people at the top ranks of their military be a whiny femboy, makes no sense for the world. Also, making a lot of black characters positions of authority while the whites are just dumb idiots, of course.+1 for actual character development which is lacking in shows.Overall still feels a bit like a Sci-Fi channel show, and wish they follow the source material a bit more as in staying tru to the world. And please quit with the DEI bs, and know your audience.",7
One of the greatest video game movie adaptions ever!,"Fallout was such a joy to witness in live action especially being such a huge fan of the game series. What is awesome about Fallout is even if you have never played one entry in the video game series you still will have a blast with this Amazon tv series. It moves at a fast pace with high violence, gore, action, and alot of comedy. It's everything I would have dreamed for in a Fallout tv series and more. What is also very nice is this tv series is not a straight story out of the video game but instead a new story set in the Fallout game universe. I loved how season 1 wrapped up and I'm looking forward to a season 2! Amazon has a huge hit on their hands here. Fallout gets a perfect 10 stars out of 10.",10
Its good....or bad...or great,"Its a New view on the Fallout universe and in my opinion its good. If you love Bethesda latest releases ( FO4 and FO76) you will love, watch and rewatch this series....if you're more a Obsidian / Originals you'll surely have a more critical view but try to watch it for what it is - a New aproach on a beloved Universe and if you dont like the games and just want a post nuclear world like Mad Max or something with a more serious Tone, just avoid it at all costs - isnt for you, its for the Bethesda/Fallout game Fans.Its entertaining,fun to watch but with some debatable choices like choosing a more humorous aproach instead of the lore friendly one or the depiction of some characters( ghouls) or "" monsters/ creatutes"". It's generally filled with solid and sometimes good acting moments, what makes it good but Not great.",7
Parody of Fallout?,"I played the games, and this TV adaptation felt like a parody, with a vibe akin to Mars Attacks and Stepford Wives.While the games do occasionally have humour that I would describe as cheeky or even dark, this TV adaptation is just plain silly, immature and goofy. Missing are also the sometimes scary aspects of the games, as well as large and lengthy action scenes with raiders, robots and mutated humans and animals. Each new building or location in the games is exciting and unpredictable, whereas here in the TV series the locations are repetitive, the scenes dull and goofy.The acting, or direction of the actors, is mostly cartoonish but sometimes inconsistently serious/dramatic. The script is immature with sexual dialogue that feels out of place. The overall plot is paper thin; the behaviour of characters is unrealistic and illogical, and relationship development non-existent or unbelievable. There are no heroes to be found, nor a mission or characters to stand behind and root for. Yes, there is a ""treasure"" of sorts that everyone is after, but we don't find out what that is or does until the last episode, so the viewer doesn't know what they're supposed to be excited about. It seems as though the main focus for the writer was to come up with a plot twist for the last episode, and then, conscious of a low budget, construct plodding filler episodes between the first and last, and pad them out with irrelevant dialogue, while neglecting to build lovable characters with story arcs.Considering how rich the world of the Fallout games is, the writer didn't seem to care to really go deep with anything, as everything feels superficial! The only real credit I can give is to the production team who went above and beyond to faithfully recreate and bring to life all the art and design of the games. It makes for a really fun ""Easter egg hunt"". It's a shame, because the TV series looks like Fallout, but it doesn't feel like Fallout!",3
"A good series, despite the annoying American film school.","I played all the Fallout games and had a great time watching it! There are references to every game in the series, so people who have played at least one game will get their share of the nostalgia cake.The only thing that bothered me was the typical American-racial convention of the series, which in itself doesn't bother me, there is and must be this American vibe throughout Fallout because that's what this game is based on, BUT that makes it easy to guess what's going to happen, e.g. In the first episode, the husband is white, so I already knew it was going to be bad, although when I saw him, I thought he was either a drug addict or a violent person. But then the frame showed that everyone was dirty and cut up and I already knew who they were, because people from the crypt don't look like that, maybe they were subjected to some kind of experiment.Apart from this small stumble, the series is very well made, the set designers did a great job looking at the locations and their filling, although they were probably afraid to play more aggressively with the light. The actors played well, where Moises Arias,
Walton Goggins and Jon Daly, definitely the best.Overall, a very good series!",9
Woah now,"This was just.... such a pleasant surprise. I was super skeptical when I heard it was being made given the track record on adaptations made from games. But dang if they didn't absolutely nail this. It honestly feels like once the green light was given those in charge basically said, ""We got the IP to do it...now make it damn good."" The casting, the writing, the acting is so damn well done there is a surprise in every episode. The world building is second to none and keeps you engaged through-out the eight episodes. Heck I've one episode left and I ALMOST don't want to watch it because I know it's going to an age before season 2. Just outstanding.",9
Will be a top 10 show of all time mark my words,"A must watch for everyone, there is not anything negative to say unless you dig so deep that it just becomes pointless, sad and desperate. The pacing is better than anything else Ive seen in years, the actors are phenomenal for each and every single role. The set and world bulding is amazing, a solid 10. So is music, sound effects, story, atmosphere and so on.As soon as I understood the fact that the show would focus on multiple characters I was a bit worried, I was set on the whole show being focused around a «player» lol, but I quickly fell in love with two of them, don't get me wrong I enjoy the knight as well but he don't come close to as good as our adorable, curious and most of all BEAUTIFUL vault dweller and ofc the gunslinger ghoul who I'm sure is everyones favourite, in my opinion the ghoul stole the whole show and I don't mind at all, his story is so intriguing, brilliant and fascinating.And I almost forgot to mention the dog that I'm sure everyone loves as well, the dog is perfect and the best scenes in the show is whenever our gunslinger walks with the doggo on his side. Can't wait for season 2!!",10
A Masterpiece Video Game Adaptation,"As a longtime fan of Fallout, especially New Vegas and 4, I was looking forward to this series since I saw the trailer a month prior. I binge watched the entire series in two days, and I wasn't disappointed at all.In typical Fallout fashion, the story takes place in on a post-nuclear apocalyptic world, particularly the ruins of Los Angeles, California. There, we follow three main, widely varying, protagonists.First, there's Lucy Maclean, a naive but determined and idealistic Vault Dweller who leaves her home, Vault 3, to find her father who was abducted by a Raider chieftain named Moldaver.Next, there's Maximus, a downtrodden aspirant of the Brotherhood of Steel who gets unexpectedly promoted to squire.And finally, we have Howard Cooper aka The Ghoul, the most cynical, jaded, and experienced protagonist who was once a pre-war actor before becoming a mercenary after the apocalypse.You'll also see longtime Fallout canine character, Dogmeat for you dog-lovers out there.The main plot of first season revolves around a wild-goose chase for the severed head of a scientist named Dr. Wilzig, which carries a big secret that could change the entire world. From there, the main story expands into a few sub plots for each character in an immerse and creative manner.First of all, the aesthetic was superb and fully captured the game in every category. From the Vault to the wasteland, to the very items, weapons, enemies, items, etc. Everything matches the source material. You'll almost feels like you're playing a Fallout game as you watch the show. Plus, the action sequences were as exciting as they were fitting for a Fallout setting. Longtime fans will definitely be reminded of their past combat experiences with the slow-motion VATS styled intervals.There was plenty of character development and interactions among all three characters. Lucy becomes tougher and more hardened by the harsh realities of the wasteland (among other things). Maximus becomes disillusioned with the Brotherhood, yet ironically a respected member in the process, and even forms a romance with Lucy, and Cooper eventually transforms from an enemy to an uneasy ally to Lucy as they continue their journey.The music was a captivating mix of different sources. There is an original soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi, who took inspiration from Fallout composer Inon Zur himself. Plus, you'll hear multiple original songs and leitmotifs that any Fallout fan with recognize from past games, and plenty of golden oldies from real musical artists such as Johnny Cash, Dinah Washington, and The Inkspots.The special effects were a breathtaking mixture of CGI and practical effects that fully capture the Fallout universe. The mutant creatures, such as Radroaches, Gulpers, and a Yao Guai were beautifully detailed. Personally, I can't wait to see a Deathclaw in future seasons. I especially liked the Brotherhood Knights dressed in their T-60 power armor suits.Overall, this show succeeded where ""Halo"" failed and is a must watch for Fallout fans or just about anyone interested in the post-apocalyptic genre.",9
"True to the concept, besides of high quality","Have played all the associated game titles, starting 30 years ago, and outright love the concept of human greed, moral dilemmas, satire, gore, etc. To my joy, the TV series is 95% true to the games, incl. Character progression, stores and NPCs, factions, companions, environments, details and soundtrack - excellent and above expectations. ...extra credits for re-creating Red Rocket.The big difference compared to the games, is that the TV series is of high production quality ...maybe Bethesda will pick up a few pointers?The TV series isn't following a specific game title but seem to somewhat mix from each, which I find perfectly fine. Similarly, flashbacks are used in a good way for story and character build-up. The pace of the story ought to leave plenty of room for additional seasons.",9
Hands down! Great show!,"This show is brilliant! The humor, the style, the drama, the details, the atmosphere, the characters, the actors, the soundtrack...! Just unbelievable! I haven't had so much fun watching the first couple of episodes of any TV show for quite some time.You get thrown right into this world from the start with all it's lore and aesthetics. And you want to see more, explore it all even as a passive viewer. They doing an incredible job taking you with them into the retro-futuristic lands of post-nuclear America bringing you joy, laughter, tenderness, art, slapstick, gore, irony and stuff to think about, sometimes even all in one scene.I can highly recommend this show to anyone with a deep sense of humor and the hopes to find something great to watch out of the ordinary.Please bring us more seasons like that!",10
"I have played Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4 and this is what I think","I was so excited for this one. Cause I really liked Arcane and Cyberpunk, the Witcher even The Last of Us was decent enough that I did not feel a slog watching through it. Warcraft was not a 10 for me I still liked it.But out of all of these, Fallout has one of the most interesting world in Video games, say what you want about the quality of their later games, but they know how to build the worlds.Fallout TV show starts out great, they go over the skills and you start feeling good about it, but then it all falls a part. I personally think the premise of 3 vaults is not a bad one, but the execution was. There are so many plot holes and the people are made out to be just stupid, that is the biggest crime of all. Everything is so goofy. The outside world looks good but not great, you do get the fallout feeling but is so empty. A girl who comes from a vault and is bright and stupid at the same way, get trough it all like there is no danger at all, always someone there to save her. What was she gonna do, dive after the gulper if Cooper did not kidnap her. There are so many moments like that, plot armor is think on this one.I liked episode 4 and 8 they were the most action packed. But the overall writing is just bad, it just makes no sense. That makes this show for someone who sees things logically a really hard watch, and not logically as everything has to be like in real life, but in the Fallout world logic. In games the protagonist is weak at the beginning but finds things along the way to aid him/her. I was hoping so much she finds something, a melee weapon maybe, nope.Lets talk about vaults, so the vault 33 and 32 are supposed to be puppets for vault 31 management who sends overseers for those two vaults. Jet somehow the vault of 32 dies out 2 years before we see the show and no one knew? Really? And we are supposed to believe that a tiny brain bot that cant even navigate, is somehow the mastermind who controls all of it? Mind you all are wearing pitboys when the supposed raiders from Vault 32 are coming to visit. And none of them detect radiation?Lets talk about the supposed ""Raiders"" you telling me that a woman who wants to heal the world goes into a vault and murders innocent people? Mind you they have a colony of their own where they actually could clean up but they go to the visit all dirty? What about the plot, we see Lucy taking the ""Husband"" to her room where she finds out that he is not from the vaults but outside cause of the radiation warning the pitboy gives. And the vault 32 died out 2 years ago, and what are we supposed to believe that those 2 years someone sat in the overseers computer and set up the marriage some how, plausible but its such a stretch. How did the ""raiders"" suddenly appear in armor and weapons, was no one watching out for the vault, there were no guards? In every fallout world that has people living in the vaults they have guards.I mean I could write double what I have already said about the plot holes and inconsistencies trough out the show, but I think you get the point. I actually think it would have been better not having played the games at all before this, that way I would not have had many questions that might have ruined it for me.The first season ended in a high note for me though, here's to hoping second season mends the mistakes of the first one.Among my friends most people do not like the shows(Travelers, Stranger things, Band of Brothers, Narcos, Arcane, The Umbrella Academy, Blood of Zeus and Game of thrones etc.) that I like and most like the shows that I do not, so maybe this review speaks of just some of the people who are gonna watch it, but for those who have played the games I think this is not the best.",6
Masterful worthy of high ratings!,"I've only played a bit of Fallout 3 on PS3 years ago and this makes me want to play more of the games available at least for me since I only have PS5 now regardless would highly recommend this to anyone! The amazing flow of directing, soundtrack is fire, casting is great and I must say I enjoy anything from Jonathan Nolan; ironically my last name is Nolan I'm just not related to anyone famous.I haven't had Amazon since January before today the Fallout series is perfect choice back to the service in my opinion Amazon and HBO are the best entertainment I never understood the hype with Netflix it's enjoyable occasionally. Anyways though Fallout is phenomenal in every aspect, I appreciate the authenticity of the of everything put into everything. I definitely want to play more of the games soon.Seriously my review got hate already if it makes a difference I have autism.",10
Pretty good,"(Note: I completed the Fallout 3 game but do not consider myself to be a fan, per se).The TV adaptation of the beloved video game ""Fallout"" has finally hit the screens, and while it brings the iconic post-apocalyptic world to life with impressive art direction and set design, it struggles in some critical areas, particularly storytelling.First and foremost, the representation of the game's world is superb. The art direction is amazing, capturing the essence of Fallout's retro-futuristic aesthetic with incredible attention to detail. The sets are beautifully crafted, showcasing the passion and dedication of the production team. However, while the CGI is generally good, there are moments where it could have used a bit more polish.The show's gore is in line with the Fallout IP, and while it is integral to the universe, it can occasionally feel a bit distracting. This, however, is a minor gripe and largely forgivable given the context of the series.Despite these strong points, the show's storytelling is not perfect. One of the main issues is the improbable frequency with which characters run into each other in the vast wasteland. This constant string of coincidences strains credulity and detracts from the otherwise immersive experience.Character comparisons also fall a bit flat. Maximus, for instance, feels like a clone of Finn from Star Wars, lacking a unique identity. Similarly, the Ghoul character comes across as a rehashed version of William from Westworld. These similarities diminish the originality that fans expect from a Fallout adaptation.Moreover, character consistency is another area where the show falters. Lucy, for example, is portrayed as naive due to her upbringing, yet she demonstrates formidable combat skills. This juxtaposition of naivety and adeptness in fighting creates a disconnect, as her level of training should realistically come with a better understanding of the dangers of the wasteland. While her moments of comedy are relatable, they sometimes translate into frustration when she fails to recognize obvious threats.Overall, ""Fallout"" is not a bad show. I was entertained and I will be watching season 2. It offers a visually stunning experience with high production values. However, it falls short of brilliance due to its storytelling flaws and character inconsistencies. It's an enjoyable watch, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of shows like ""Succession"" or ""Severance.""",7
Fellout Of My Couch,"I Fellout of my couch because i had fallen asleep in episode three. Was it because it was boring? Was it because it was insipid? Was it because it was so contrived? Was it because all the actors were bland, not only unbelievable but unrelatable? I am convinced it was of all the above.Pro: Looks bright and colorful.Cons: CG is smeared on some of the creatures and looks almost as bad as the Scorpion King movie. Too plastic and silly moving. Especially the mutated bear. It looks awful.Walton Goggings is Walton no matter the role. Whether it be in The Shield, SOA, Fallout, He is always going to be Walton.The lead is silly, annoying and unbelievableThe music is atrocious. At first it is novel and cute but by the middle of episode one the Yankovich style covers get really old really fast. The rest of the old re-hashed songs of the 40s and 50s just get mind numbingly trite.The writing in very lazy. We have to go here to see this but first have to do this and see that before we can actually do anything. Just terribly lazy.The rest of the cast is exactly what we Hollywood has been directed to feed us.... No substance or relatable traits.Easy pass on this one.",2
Superb show that perfectly captures the fallout quirkiness,"The first episode really primes you for what looks like is going to be one of the best adaptations made, the whole premiere plays like an epic movie.Fantasy and scifi novels, anime and video games have been adapted as movies and tv shows for a long time, but they mostly fall short, but Fallout really seems promising from the first episode! After watching it I immediately felt like binge-watching the whole season!The fan service, references to a multitude of familiar things from the games, really makes the gamer in me squirm like a teenager. The storytelling giving us three very different perspectives that help bridge the gap for the audience that isn't acquainted with the Fallout lore. The perfect composition for the first episode that sets up the anticipation for the inevitable merge of those three perspectives, when you realize two characters are looking for the same things and the third's vengeful path leads to where that thing is. The sounds, the music, the typical Fallout dark humour, the stunning visuals... down to the casting choice for an actor whose smile and demeanour remind you so much of the vault infomercials.Not to mention Walton Goggins' character that really helps connect the present state of things with the past that led to it. I thought he'd carry the show alone but Ella Purnell really does a great job at embodying the first time player that gets out of the vault for a main quest and gets lost in side quests and gradually becomes more badass, while Aaron Moten's performance made me think he should be the new actor for MCU's Kang!Nothing to add but ""superb""! A show that can stand on its own as a triple A even if it weren't being lifted by the fame of the game it's adapting, while simultaneously providing a completely novel plot beyond the ones from the game franchise. It's probably one of the best post apocalyptic TV shows made recently, alongside Silo.",10
War. War never changes.,"I thought the excellent The Last Of Us was the best onscreen video-game adaptation so far. And it was. Until now. Fallout is similarly well realised with great attention to detail, very well acted by a great cast and a budget to do it justice. Where I give it a slight edge over TLOU is purely down to it being an original story, albeit set within the Fallout world. While TLOU was a brilliantly faithful retelling of the game's story, this had much more tension for viewers not knowing where it was going. I assume this will be renewed for more seasons as this is top quality! A tip of the hat to all involved!",9
Not a video gamer,"I didn't play the Fallout game (although I briefly played the mini game on my phone) and I'm so excited for this show! My husband and I binged the entire season this weekend and I'm so sad it ended. I do love anything in the post apocalyptic style / dystopian thrillers and this show is it! The acting is top notch, interesting/unique storyline, and the sets & costumes are great. I think this has the potential to be a HUGE hit. It makes me want to start Halo now. As a non video gamer, these shows plus Last of Us are hits even amongst the non gamer. I'm super looking forward to the next season...I could see so many ways the show could possibly go. I can't wait for more!!",9
Great watch but depressingly relevant,"Started the series out of boredom with lower expectations than you can imagine but am genuinely impressed by the show in all aspects. I've loved the games since a kid but purely for gameplay/aesthetics so above all else I was surprised how great the storytelling of it all is, nuance and depth are actually used in how they present the many factions in universe and not even in some bland centrist way either. My only criticism is the egregious levels of fan service at times but at least it's usually subtle so not too obnoxious. The political themes from the games are even well presented, always felt like some subtly is missed by many fans but it's all in your face here.",9
I am blown away (hahaha get it?),"What a show, it had everything. The story slowly clicks into place and you want, no, need to know more. This serie had my full attention, something not many series seem to achieve since I have my mobile phone to distract me. I love how the world is built I love how the characters don't play the cliche ""ohhh you lied to me now we can't be friends lines."" It was a journey, a great one and I long for more. Seems to be that series inspired by or made from videogames are a new wellgoing trend.I defintately would reccomend it, it makes you think how much power the people who rule us really have. And how much power money actually has.",9
This is how you adapt a video game into a show!,"As a life long fan of Fallout, I was hesitant to show any excitement for this series. Watching my favorite works of Tolkien get completely butchered by Prime with the show we do not name, my hopes were not high. However, within the first 5 minutes of episode 1, I was hooked and so gratefully surprised. Every single episode had me glued. I love all the references. You do not have to know anything about the games to get into this show. Those that have played the games will love all the nods and subtle to blatant references and appreciate all the effort that truly went into the creation of this. The only thing I'm upset about is that I have to wait til 2026 for season 2!",10
Something is off and i can't figure out what it is,"Unfortunately, even after the eighth episode, i was still not fully into the series.There's something wrong with this series. I'm unsure if it's this weird feeling of the cheap environnement? The way it's recorded? How the characters seem so detached from around them? Lack of logic? They had an enormous budget to film this series and i think it's part of the problem.Cheap environnement: i think we can agree how some CGI, some landscape and some VFX are poorly made (gun shot, Cooper makeup/ghoul skin looks so bad, T-60s don't even look solid).There is no interaction or chemistry between the characters and their environment (Lucy getting out of the vault and not even impress by everything new around her).Lack of logic: There were so many scenes where everything mades absolutely no sense : Lucy getting her finger cuts without even screaming? Selling Lucy to a huge organisation for vials (when in fact, it's only run by 2 stoned guys or 2 idiots, hard to tell?), Cooper getting a huge load of vial and we don't see them anymore the rest of the show.Oh and, can we talk about the Brotherhood? Looks like every of their recruits are some dumbass with no education? (first or second episode) how in hell Maximum can't even recognize an electric circuit?Oh and, can we talk about the Siggi Wilzig story line? Poor background story, we don't know much about him, there's a massive alert in his factory and no one is checking for him DURING the alarm and after? He then magically managed to escape by walking out of the factory and dodged 100 bullets from the turret.And so much more...TLDR: everything feels off but the plot is decent.",7
Great season 1,"Do hope this series will get another season. I never play the game but do know bout bits and pieces of the lore (thank you video essay) and this series is very entertaining and well done.The story is engaging. Simple and yet amazingly well put. The violence is very... violent. Over the top, lots of gruesome stuffs that made me look away from the screen or just cringe, but like it fits the wasteland and the situation they are in.Theres only an editing error or like splicing (?) that doesn't make sense and put me out of the story, but other than that, I enjoyed every minute of it. Kinda sad that the s1 is finish and who knows when the next season will be out.I like the characters. Lucy is very nice as a protagonist. She started as someone who is quite naive because of her upbringing to become a survivor without truly losing herself.I love the ghoul character, though it reminded me so much of that character in westworld.I also love the musics and the retro 60s aesthethic contrasted with apocalypse. Always something I enjoyed to see from the fallout games.Also big shout to the best girl, the doggo. Cx404 / Dogmeat, you are amazing.",8
"""Everybody wants to save the world, they just disagree on how.""","What a pleasant surprise. I don't think I've seen a videogame adaptation that just gets the source material like this one. The tone, the world, the characters, this isn't just a show based on Fallout, this IS Fallout. The writing, however, can be hit or miss. The show definitely sticks closer to Bethesda's style of writing with its reliance on flashy high-concept setpieces with little depth to them. It makes the show enjoyable, if a bit repetitive, but ultimately a bit shallow. It also does that annoying thing a lot of bad shows do where there's no sense of geography and the characters just sort of teleport to wherever they need to be. The third episode is undeniably the show's lowest point as the show briefly turns into an unfunny sitcom where nothing happens. I wish we could see more of Hank in the beginning to see what kind of person he is. The characters in general feel somewhat underdeveloped, which is disappointing given how much the show focuses on them. Lucy's arc is sweet even though she comes across as a bit too childish at times, The Ghoul is charismatic as hell and watching his transformation from an idealist who believes in the American dream into a bitter and cynical nihilist is fascinating. Maximus is a great character to represent the Brotherhood because of how much he doesn't fit their ideals. He's a sociopath but instead of being a calculating manipulator he's an incompetent buffoon who's bad at pretty much everything he does, what a fascinating character. Ther whole thing feels a bit like a hyper-violent saturday morning cartoon. The show, however, has plenty of great moments, such as the whole Vault 4 subplot which nicely subverts your expectations, feels like a sidequest in New Vegas. In the second half after a couple of filler episodes the show finally decides to become good again and the ending is just firing on all cilinders. The snake oil salesman might be one of my favorite background characters ever. Can't wait for season 2.",6
Unfamiliar with the game but this is all wrong.,"Maybe it's for those that enjoyed the game but so many elements in this require massive suspension of belief that it's impossible to not cringe.World got destroyed in an alternate 50s and we are 200, not 20 but 200 years in the future. Some people survive in underground vaults and our protagonist is about to go on an adventure to the surface.Has it been 200 years or are we in present day Detroit. No imagination when it comes to any of the designs .We have tires and trash laying around. Just about every scene has a tire laying in the background. Makeshift buildings. People engaging in cannibalism to survive. Clean concrete roads from before. Yet we also have advanced robotics and technology in the hands of people wearing rags. So people can't figure out sewing? Food, clothing and shelter is basic survival that people would figure out or go extinct. Roads get fully covered in dirt in 1-2 years.The story does the old trick of keeping us guessing to make the viewer watch more episode. Instead of being invested in the character succeeding on her quest, we are invested to find out what's it all about. Plus our heroine and side heroes just happen to stumble upon that one thing they need whenever they need it. Over and over and over again.The actors do a good job and are the only thing that bring any life to this.",4
Did Fallout good,"I was expecting a typical lame series loosely based on the game, but I was surprised. It's just a really good series, even if you haven't played the games. To be clear, you don't have to be an F fan to like this, but ask your F friends about some of the background info. But, if you have played them, you will be pleasantly surprised. There is a lot of accurate game candy in it. So many incidental bits from the games, the little details like the random foods. Even a totally accurate power armor rack. This is a story that isn't in any of the games, but that's not a problem, it fits the universe just fine. One small bit I found somewhat strange the 3 interconnected vaults. All the vaults were independent in the games, but it's not that big of a stretch, and it is needed for the particular plot. I think what the overwhelming positive response to this really means is that Bethesda totally blew it abandoning what is arguably the top video game series ever done. F76 was a disaster, Starfield a total mess. Maybe they will find their way again and come out with a new game that really fits the Fallout universe. Hint - don't try to throw in every concept you ever heard of, but with a lame storyline. Starfield if you can't figure that out. Looking forward to the next season. And yes, I binged all 8 episodes in 2 days. Not sure why AZ chose to release them all at once, but thanks. OTOH, I'm already in withdrawal. Now if they would just add Cait in power armor, life would be great.",9
"Started off a bit goofy, got great!","Played most of the games.I though they rushed the beginning a bit. Could've build up the start of the shows premises way more.And I had some difficulties getting into certain characters like Maximus..
But from episodes 4 things started getting better and to me it just kept rising until the last episode which really made me truly happy.So many game references! And without it distracting from the story, perfectly implemented.Beautiful music, straight out of the games.Made the world of the games truly come to life, seeing familiar stuff in every sceneVery much recommended, just the first episodes could be a bit of a slog imo.",10
Maximus is the worst character ever written.,"Huge Fallout fan and this show does a pretty good job world building and putting its own spin on things. Walton Goggins is awesome as you would expect but doesn't get enough screen time. They waste so much time and effort on the most unlikeable, idiotic, abysmally inept little sook Maximus. Everything he does is annoying and ridiculously frustrating. Easily the worst character ever put on screen. The guy can't act either which makes it even more intolerable. The best thing for the show would be to write him out immediately and replace him with an actual lead. Lucy is okay but could benefit from some better writing to expand her acting range. Excited for season 2 provided they write out that moron maximus.",9
"If someone tells you this show is below an 8. Walk away. This show is easily an 8,9 or 10.",First off Bravo to everyone who worked on the show. From Show runners to script writers all the way to actors and producers and the costume department. Literally everyone.This show is amazing. It has beat expectations or if anything surpassed it by light years. When I finished Season 1 I was left wanting more... Way more! Most video game adaptations leave you in a state of okay till next season I guess or sometimes even doing so terrible you don't even care to watch the next season. But this... This is so wildly good it's the best Video Game adaptation I've ever seen. It leaves me to wonder why people would rate this lower than an 8.The writing is literally that best I have seen. The actors are amazing some even playing the Fallout games so they know what they are in for. Everything was perfect it was like playing a new Fallout Game.,10
What video game adaptations should aspire to be.,"Well cast and written. Stellar performances from the core cast. Gets the tone and art style of the games almost perfect. Very good and watchable for fans and casuals alike. Some potential (but fixable with a season 2 or future game) game continuity problems, weird choice of arm rockets over the game beloved jet pack and slightly rough de-aging in one scene are the minor points that JUST hold the show back from perfection. Really does put almost all other video game adaptations to shame. If this level of quality is maintained, I really hope they make a season 2. 9/10 from both me (game fan) and my partner. (New to the franchise.)",9
Fallout: Disney,"It's got a high production value and good visuals. And some of the main actors are decent. But there are so many things not to like. The script is terrible. The characters are one dimensional and over the top. The action sequences are worse than a bad 80s TV series. The gore is like the rubber era of the 80s, too. Too much and like the rubber era (kind of like Robocop '87 and Total Recall, but dumber).The characters and settings look like a kids show. But with all the gore and dark setting it doesn't make any sense.On top of all that, there's a lack of chemistry among the cast. The actors do their thing but they have to explicitly tell you how they feel all the time.I guess Amazon Prime likes to make garbage content. It could've been great if Joy-Nolan made it like the first season of Westworld but it looks like they were told to dumb it way down.",
The drawbacks of basing your series on a video game.,"The pluses are of course the lead actors. Walton Goggins adding depth and detail to a relatively simplistic ""cowboy"" role, adding menace and meaning all the way, somewhat constricted by a large amount of effects makeup.Ella Purnell stepped up her already solid game from a good performance in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and a series of not that great other projects. She's great in this though.I hadn't noticed Aaron Moten before, although he was in the terrible emancipation movie, he's great in this. I really liked his fumbling and mumbling delivery. It seemed natural and real.The world design was great. The future as we saw it from the 50s and 60s. One that was never delivered, but seemed so much more fun.The downside was the over the top gore, which I'm sure plays out well on a video game but in this story it seemed gratuitous. The finger cutting off thing. In this world you can pull a dead finger and graft it onto your stump and you're fine, but did we have that tech in the 1950s or even now. Nope. So it comes across as brutal, gratuitous and unbelievable, which is saying something in this work or already stretch fiction world. I get that it was a bit, but, it wasn't that great and maybe it was just the way it was done. What are supposed to do with this scene etc. How are we supposed to feel when a ghoul chops off a girls finger right in front of her face, for what reason? It's cheesy overused shock value.The brutality was unnecessary, but I guess we've come to expect this of people like Jonathan Nolan. The first series of Westworld was likewise brutal but seemed to be saying something, but the next 3 series said nothing of worth.There was a bunch of touch stone political ideas thrown in but it did seem a bit piecemeal, one of the 'political concepts' they threw in almost made me laugh as the character delivered it pretty much like reading a meme off social media. There might be some insight on offer but it didn't come across well and didn't seem that insightful, but what do we expect, it's based on a video game, and they seem to have purposefully kept that clunky aspect in this series. Pick up the jewel to get the reward, you've got bonus power, etc etc. I think they thought it was clever and paying respect to the game it was based on, but, I'm here devoting my time to this program and clunky just doesn't cut it.So hence my average response to this. I loved Walton Goggins, watching him act is a reward in itself, but it could have been so much better if the dumped the gore, filtered out the game play stuff, and really focused the vision of the world so it said something instead of a mish mash of rhetoric thrown in a blender. There's probably something decent in there but it's hard to filter it out with all the noise.",6
I accidentally binged it... and don't regret it.,"I've played a few of the games this is based on and figured this production would go one of two ways. Thankfully, it went well.Firstly, for fans of the game, it's Easter Egg galore and very faithful to what I know of the game series. The series focuses on a handful of core characters with some worthy supporting roles for secondary characters which also feels very inkeeping with the game. As, too, is the violence... a lot of violence, which may be off-putting for some.The plot is game-level generic with some predictable twists and turns, but it works really well in this format; it's not a preachy story with bad attempts at political commentary or subtext - it's a straight-up post-apocolyptic survival story, where few people are good or bad, but a blur of both as they struggle to survive in a ruined wasteland.I recommend it to fans of the game and to people who broadly like the genre.",8
Great with Flaws,"Fallout is one of the best video game adaptations to exist, however, some of the acting and writing in the show takes you out of the feel of the show that it strives greatly to achieve. I felt the writing around Maximus's character was sub par compared to the rest of the show, his acting also felt very shoehorned. All this to say, the show is great and had perfect vibes one would expect from a Fallout adaptation. Ella Purnel was a huge standout and highlight of the show, her acting was great along with being the only character who felt like a real person, other than Walter Goggins most characters felt very one-dimensional and barely had a character at all, Ella Purnel and Walter Goggins made up for this however.",7
"Looks good, but... kind of boring?","I didn't play the games, so came into this not knowing any of the lore etc that all the 10/10 gamer reviewers seem to have.While the visuals and production are amazing and give a real sense of the world setting, I'm left wondering what was the point of it all? Admittedly, I never finished watching the full season, I got to ep.6 and realised that I didn't care about any of the characters and stopped there. Maybe more depth will come with the second season, but I won't be watching it to find out.I get that it'll appeal to those familiar with the franchise, but I feel like for the majority that watch not knowing much of the background it'll come across as tedious to watch.",3
9/10 - How To Look Like That In A Wasteland Tho?,"I haven't played the games and after few episodes, I started to wonder this looks somewhat similar to Silo (2023) TV Series and since the first game came out in 90s, did that show ""borrow"" ideas from the game but then reading some trivia, found out this show's story and plot is completely different than the games others than characters, setting and perhaps few references here and there.Great series, enjoyed the characters and despite being very heavy emotional typical dark dystopian future for humanity it had it's moments of mild humor too.One ""secret"" I really would like to find out is, HOW to stay and look in pristine condition while mostly walking around for miles in a wasteland filled with deserts and radiation affected plant life. Lucy, one of the lead female character, had ZERO marks anywhere on her face, her uniform always stayed in mint condition and even her hair were not only neatly tied up all the time but stayed shiny as if she just had her hair done by a professional. The ONLY little mark shown on her face was that minor cut on her lips that happened during one of the action sequences.I would love to know the secret of staying like that, it must be some sort of magic in future, right? It simply can't be a ""Hollywood"" magic....",9
"Fallout is the perfect blend of science fiction and horror, with a massive universe that sucks you in like Game of Thrones","My wife and I finally finished Fallout (2024) on Prime. The storyline follows a post-apocalyptic world where a nuclear bomb has destroyed civilization. The surface is plagued by radiation, while some survivors live in commercial bunkers underground. When a bunker community is invaded and its leader kidnapped, his daughter offers to leave the bunker to find and rescue him. She's in for a rude awakening as she discovers just how different the world is from her bunker.This series was co-created by Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley) and stars Ella Purnell (Yellowjackets), Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight), Aaron Moten (Emancipation), and Leslie Uggams (Deadpool).The special effects, attire, soundtrack, and backdrops brilliantly pull you into the universe and storyline, keeping you locked in. The series weaves multiple storylines that intersect and collide by the end. Interestingly, the main character is the hardest to root for, while the characters around her are the most fascinating. The subplots are well-developed and smart, and the circumstances feel realistic. My favorite episode featured the ""organ donor"" robot sequence and the drug maker concluding shootout. The Michael Rapaport episode and the foot sequence were also excellent. The final war for the head was a great climax, effectively closing out plot lines and setting up new ones for season 2.In conclusion, Fallout is the perfect blend of science fiction and horror, with a massive universe that sucks you in like Game of Thrones. This is a new classic that I would score a 9/10 and strongly recommend.",9
one of the best series i've ever watched!,"**Title: Fallout - A Captivating Adaptation of a Beloved Game**""Fallout,"" the highly anticipated series adaptation of the iconic video game franchise, delivers a gripping portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world. Set in an alternate history where nuclear advancements after World War II led to a retrofuturistic society and a devastating resource war, the series paints a vivid picture of the aftermath of a nuclear exchange.The narrative follows Lucy, a young woman emerging from Vault 33, one of the many underground bunkers designed to protect humanity from nuclear annihilation. Unbeknownst to most inhabitants, these Vaults were actually sites for psychological experiments. Lucy's journey begins as she ventures into the perilous wasteland of ruined Los Angeles in search of her father. Along the way, she encounters a squire from the Brotherhood of Steel and a ghoul bounty hunter, each with their own enigmatic backgrounds and hidden agendas.The series excels in world-building, effectively capturing the essence of the Fallout universe. The retrofuturistic aesthetic, combined with the stark desolation of the post-nuclear landscape, creates a visually stunning backdrop that fans of the games will appreciate. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and special effects immerses viewers in this bleak yet fascinating world.The characters are well-developed, each bringing their own unique perspectives and skills to the narrative. Lucy's determination and resilience make her a compelling protagonist, while the squire and ghoul add depth and intrigue to the story with their mysterious pasts. The interactions between these characters drive the plot forward and keep the audience engaged.One of the standout elements of ""Fallout"" is its incredible cast. The actors deliver stellar performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. The chemistry between the cast members enhances the storytelling, making the relationships and conflicts more believable and engaging. Their performances add an extra layer of immersion, drawing viewers deeper into the narrative.""Fallout"" successfully blends action, drama, and suspense, staying true to the themes of survival and human nature that are central to the games. The series does an excellent job of exploring the moral complexities and ethical dilemmas faced by individuals in a world where society has collapsed.Overall, ""Fallout"" is a must-watch for fans of the video game series and newcomers alike. It offers a captivating and faithful adaptation that honors its source material while providing a fresh and engaging narrative. The series sets a high bar for video game adaptations and leaves viewers eagerly anticipating future seasons.",10
Will blow you away (pun very much intended),"Fallout was my most anticipated series of this year, and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint.First of all, it looks spectacular. They absolutely nailed the look and aesthetic of the Fallout universe, and its reliance on more practical effects, rather than overusing CGI like most modern series, really showed.The cast was very good. Ella Purnell was a charismatic lead, and it goes without saying, but you can't go wrong with Walton Goggins.The story was very well written, making the show part of the same continuity of the games, without adapting any game in particular, I think, was a good choice. It truly felt like the writers respected the source material, which unfortunately is a very rare trait in video game adaptations.Following on from the success of The Last of Us, Fallout makes me look forward to the future of video game adaptations, and very excited for the Mass Effect and God of War series Amazon Prime currently have in development, as it is clear that they can make a TV series based on a popular video game series, truly incredible.9/10 - Amazing.",9
"Amusingly Accurate, while not alienating new viewers","This captures so much that I expected from a Fallout show. The set design, costumes, make-up, storylines, NPC's all bring this show to life. So engaging, wonderful twists and turns, and it felt like you were behind the wheel, taking in the choices and seeing how our heroine Lucy decided to lead her path. It was incredible to watch a show that had to have been the cost of a full length cinematic film. The sheer amount of details they weaved told the story so well, but left a ton of Easter eggs for the die hard gamers to enjoy. Rock solid casting from the main characters to the one-offs. I had a blast watching it, and I cannot wait for another season.",9
A great first season,"+ ""Fallout"" is a fun series that definitely gets better in later episodes (episode 4 is what did it for me). The overall design and scenery is immaculate and seriously astoundingly well made. A lot of scenes seem to be filmed in actual locations which is a big plus as well. Overall the story is engaging and the acting is great.Unfortunately there are many scenes that happen clearly because the writers need them to happen at that point with the only guiding force being happenstance.Smn listens in at exactly the right time to hear exactly what the audience needs to hear, smthn is discovered only because it needs to be discouvered no matter how likely it is; every main character is basically on the same path because it needs to be that way, it felt quite forced and almost rushed at times which unfortunately reduces the quality of the show overall for me.That said, the fact that I still gave it an 8 should tell you that all the rest is very well done and well worth a watch. I hope future seasons can do away with so many ""random teammeetings"" and ""perfect timings"" to ground it a little more in a 10/10 for me.",8
Some rough parts,"This had a lot of nostalgic elements from the games, it's music and set. I'm sure a lot of gamers like me would appreciate many parts of the world come to life. The main character is alright, she's full of pep and enthusiasm that would fit a vault dweller. But the ghoul is the main highlight of the show, he very quickly steals everyone else's attention, feels like the first few episodes of the Mandalorian.Maximus however, had so much inconsistencies and later on he acts as if he's written by two different people.. Many parts of the series portrays him as very weak then later on acts like an experienced wastelander... then another episode of him acting all weak and stupid again. His inconsistencies like his disappearing branding and all of a sudden his idiocy was contagious enough to even affect the main character - who was naive the first parts of the series, then experienced, then suddenly back to being silly again. Perhaps the writers had rad poisoning. He is basically like Star Wars' Finn. Boring, uninteresting, I even had to google for the correct spelling of his name, that's how memorable he was.Love interests in the entire series had no chemistry, no love and all business. Remove that and it won't affect the story at all.The season ending was kind of everything I'd expect the series to end, but a bit flat.. there was chaos but I sense no excitement at all, even with the Ghoul appearing. Overall I'd give this a 6.5, it's the Ghoul that saved this series to be honest, I'd watch season 2 if it's just him.",6
Can't stand Bethesda games. LOVED this show.,"Whether you're a fan of the games, can't stand the games, or know absolutely nothing about the games- this show is a hit! Captivating, funny, doesn't hold back. The costumes, the sets, all of it is incredible. I am disappointed that the season is only 8 episodes long. By the end, I was debating picking up one of the games and playing it. I've disliked every Bethesda game I've ever played and would never have considered it had the show not been as good as it is. I wasn't necessarily a fan of the lead male character. His acting was great, but something was really missing there. WARNING: THE SHOW IS VIOLENT.",9
"Great production, meager story","I've played Fallout 3, New Vegas and gave up completing Fallout 4, so I'm familiar with the universe, but not a die-hard fan of the franchise.On the whole, I enjoyed the show. It does a great job of presenting the world I know from the video games, capturing the tone, the art style and even some of the humor that made the games such a great experience. There's an atmosphere to the show that is instantly recognizable to any gamer who spent time in the wasteland. Special effects are quite good, and there's a density to the set design and props that makes the world feel more real and lived in.Acting ranges from decent to excellent. Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins stand out, and are able to overcome some fairly campy dialogue to deliver performances that are both memorable and fun to watch.Unfortunately, I feel like the show stumbles with telling a compelling story. There are several instances where the plot develops a little too conveniently. Characters just happen across each other at the exact right time and place for the story to progress, with no explanation given. There are also a couple of writing choices where my suspension of disbelief went right out the window. Most importantly, when I finished episode 8, I still didn't have any idea of what the story was really about. What point were they trying to get across? Why did they make this show in the first place? As with most new media these days, it felt a little like they wanted to make a show around a familiar franchise, and then hired some writers to accomplish that, rather than starting off with a burning desire to tell a Fallout story.All in all, it's an entertaining watch, but it's not a 10 out of 10 experience as many here seem to suggest. If you moderate your expectations story-wise, you'll have a good time with Fallout.",6
Atomic Village of Fools,"I'm a huge Fallout fan, and I was wondering what a big company like Amazon did.When I watched all 8 episodes, I realized that I was brutally cheated, and the funny thing is that I didn't even pay for a subscription. The series is so disappointing to me.Let's start with the visual aspect. The visuals are horrible, and only 10% of the content is similar to what was in the game. Where are the same two-headed cows? The super mutants? The Death Claw? It's all crumpled, and I'm surprised the set designers didn't even open up a map to at least 3-4 of the Fallout series. The cities in the series look boring and poorly designed. One-story buildings, even if it's a large city, are no different from a settlement. Many people will say that the series departs from the adaptation of the game. But I have a question, why was to use the basic design and the game, why these posters and other visuals from the game to deceive fans I correctly understood, not a bad move).The space is visually poorly designed. How can it be that a knight's assistant stops at the Red Rocket, has vegetation around him, and 15 minutes later in the next episode of the same series finds himself in the desert? How does that work?Roads are another problem. The asphalt in major cities, especially near the nuclear sinkhole, is flat and smooth, cars are parked, not overturned, not dismantled. It looks absurd.Bloopers:When cowboy Cowboy Gul came to give Lucy to the robot ""Mr. Helper"", for some reason the store stands whole and unharmed, only powdered with dust, but 100-500 meters away the buildings are blown to rubble. How is that even possible?In one of the episodes, when Lucy is kicked out of the bunker by the sectarians, a soldier steals a nuclear battery. In the next shot, he shows up in his armor. But no one noticed that he threw the armor under the bridge?Some might say that the armor was in the bunker, but the funny thing is that it was the same power armor that the soldier left under the bridge. Difference: claw marks on the power armor from the bear."" How was he able to come back in such a short period of time with the armor already on, how did he get out of the bunker? How did he enter the bunker?Dialogues, they're as stupid as possible. In one of the episodes: Lucy and a soldier come to the crater, which was left after the atomic explosion. Lucy asks the soldier: ""I wonder if anyone is still alive""?In short, I concluded that we Fallout fans have been duped. And amazon signed a contract not with professional directors, but with 6-year-old children.",3

"Very good, but has issues.","I enjoyed the show a lot as a fan of game series, but the plot has incredible inconsistencies, not related to games, just bad setups, that I doubt will hold up on second viewing.I still consider the show massive success and can't wait for second season, but I hope following issues won't repeat in following season.The show has major issue with writing. Most of the major conflicts/situations are setup in a completely nonsensical way just to create drama, when upon resolving it you find the whole setup does not make sense at all in regards to characters motivations. Ie initial setup makes sense upon first viewing, not knowing all information, but once you understand who the characters are and their motivations, the initial setup makes absolutely no sense and is not something that the characters would ever do. Writers essentially need to create drama and violence in this show, while also having characters who sometimes turn out good. But the writing is somewhat poor, so the way they do it is to render the characters bad/evil and then resolve it as ""hey, we are the good guys actually"", which falls apart, because the whole initial conflict could be resolved with 5 minute talk, which they can't have, because then none of it would make any sense.Spoilers:1) Right at start, the whole setup with raiders coming in and brutalizing everyone makes absolutely no sense upon finishing the season. Moldaver as the villain was clearly not a villain and while as everyone in wasteland is perfectly fine with violence that whole massacre makes zero sense. Why did she not say what the overseer did? Did she not know everyone else in the vault is clearly innocent? Before massacring everyone they could have, you know, talk or hold them captives and get only the overseer for the code they needed. But no, the show needed to create villain and get some violence in, so at start they created characters that were brutal and barbaric, which then absolutely does not hold up. That was not justified violence to have a revenge after Shady Sands, that was just plain massacre to give motivation to Lucy and have over the top violence at start. Moldaver was clearly extremely smart character as we find out during the season, yet at start her actions are irrationally brutal and she has zero ability to communicate to the people she is about to massacre, why? I will tell you why, because show runners wanted to create evil mysterious character, who we will slowly find out she actually is and has supposed ""depth"". But that does not work when that character actually behaves like a brutal idiot who can't tell innocent people that the guy who was their leader literally nuked the surface. But later on we are supposed to buy she is reasonable person who has altruistic motives in heart. If the story and characters acted reasonably and not like idiots, there was no reveal at the end, whole vault would be told what happened right at the start. Ie its fake drama, that is not believable, because characters don't act in a believable way true to who they are supposed to be.2) At one of the early episodes we see Goggins fight T-60 operated by Maximus who does not even have a training and it's a pretty long fight where Goggins struggles. Ie its early on and T-60 has to still be established as a super weapon. Then magically at last episode Goggins remembers T-60 have build flaw and can be essentially taken down by one shot ( sure, literal walking tank have armor flaw on the chest armor, whatever, I am not going to even talk about that ). Anyways, writers dot this, because they failed to create any better resolution to the whole fight at the end, so they bring Goggins in with his magic bullet trick to take down army of T-60s, because now he remembered he can do that. I am sorry, but that's just awful and made the whole resolution of the final fight a complete joke to me.3) The whole section with Vault with mutated inhabitants who were actually nice was equally stupid. Again, it was mostly fun, but the entire premise is stupid. They could literally tell them at begging, ""hey some of us were experimented on way back and that's why we have these mutations. Don't go to level 12 please, there is some stuff from that time. ""But again, writers needed to create drama, so while the characters are actually nice, they make them act whole time shady and suspicious, so that the main character thinks there is something wrong and audience thinks something is wrong as well. But there is not, it's just writers gaslighting audience with actions that make no sense for the actually nice characters. As in point 1, whole situation would be resolved in a roughly 2 minute chat, but they are not allowed to do that, because none of the motivations and actions of those characters would hold up. The whole gaslighting of main characters and audience to think they bring in people just to experiment on them was just gaslighting. There is actual reason why they did have the mutations, which they could easily explain to them. They do anyway in the end!!! But that would make too much sense early on and then we don't have episode. Perhaps having characters who can behave consistently at start of the episode and it's end would be better.Anyways, I realy like the show, there were many good things about it mentioned by others in it to compensate all the inconsistencies, but I hope the next season can do without these.",9
A Fantastic Video Game Show,"Before I start this review, I have to say that I have never played a Fallout game, though I know the basic premise so I won't be judging my opinion of the show based on any of the games. Though I have now finished watching the Fallout TV Show and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a post apocalypse world after a nuclear war which sees people living in vaults underground to avoid the dangers of the surface.Main Character
Ella Purnell plays Lucy McLean and she is fantastic in this show. Her character has a fantastic character development throughout and I just think she played up the role really well. She was a likeable character and somebody who was easy to root for in this show. There is a naivety to her as she interacts with other characters but it can come across as charming and gives her a way to develop.Supporting Characters
Aaron Moten plays Maximus and he is decent in his role. It personally took me longer to care about his character then the others and I just think Moten didn't convey much emotion or reason to care about him. But that does mostly change midway through the show and Moten starts to grow into the role and add some more personality.Walton Goggins plays Cooper Howard/The Ghoul and he is tremendous in both versions of his character. We see Goggins as Cooper in his prime, before the nuclear war and it is interesting to see, especially compared to his undead bounty hunter persona in the modern day story. He is very charismatic and the fact that he has all this story about him does make him the most interesting part of the show and Goggins smashes it.Moises Arias plays Norm McLean and he is very good in the show and gets given his own story arc which is actually important for the overall show. He is mostly separate from the other main characters but he does an effective job and I grew to like his character more after the first episode.This has a big cast, that have smaller roles here and they are all great. This world is full of lively people and it feels like a vibrant world because of their performances whether they be on the surface or in the vaults, it was really effective.Story
The story is great, as I said I have no idea about The Fallout story in the games but I became really invested in this shows plot and interested throughout. We see stories both on the wasteland and in the vaults and both are pretty captivating and do a good job of developing the characters. The flashbacks are good as well and are used effectively to give more context for the storytelling.Script
The show is well written, it has moments of comedy in there but also plenty of dramatic moments that made me care. There are many twists and intrigue here and I think the writing did an effective job of showing this.Style
Amazon clearly had high hopes for Fallout as you can see the massive budget used and the show looks fantastic. Both the wasteland and Vaults look so unique and fully encapsulate the tone of the show. Though, I think there were some issues, mainly the overuse of slow-mo in action scenes. I think slow-mo is a tool that can be used effectively but it has to be used carefully and this show definitely overuses it. I also know that country music is heavily involved with the games and it is well treated here but again it is just overused, especially during some of the action scenes that didn't require it.Overall
Overall, the first season of Fallout was fantastic. It made me super interested in this universe and hyped for a potential second season. Even if you haven't played any of the games, this is still a show that should be watched because I think you will really enjoy it.Rating - 9/10.",9
One of the best adaptations I have seen.,"If you're a vault dweller like me, you will have played Fallout since it first came out as an RPG back in the 90s. A sprawling and somewhat overwhelming game with a rich world and fantastic characters.It is the gem in Bethesda's catalogue.With other games receiving the Hollywood treatment, it was only time before someone took this on. Enter Johnathon Nolan.If you aren't a fan, I would suggest you search for a short introduction to the world of Fallout, but, it can be hard to follow with such a soup of themes and stories.This is well worth a watch nonetheless. It has Nolan-esque tropes and plays with time and theme.It can be a little hard to follow, and the action is taut and straight out of the playbook. Fallout has enough references and thematic callbacks, that it is hard not to like.The characters are written well, the dialogue is good, the story is true to the lore of Fallout, and the set is particularly rewarding.Walter Goggins is a fantastic actor and he carries a lot of the charm on his shoulders. As for the rest of the cast, they each perform their pieces with plum.The music, CGI and sound design are all of a fine standard, and despite Amazon's many fails, this could very well be a hit. Just as long as they don't drag it out and go meme hunting like Rings of Power.If there is any criticism, it would be that there could have been more of a callback to VATS and the gaming element. This does not detract however, as it is important to know that this is a serial and not a game.Give it a go and make your own mind up. However, it is hard to not like this show for the characters collective journeys.",9
Great Adaptation,"I watched this show and thoroughly enjoyed it with no prior knowledge of the games or lore.I recently played and finished New Vegas and Fallout 4 then followed with rewatching the show.I had low expectations on the second watch as adaptations usually do not stay true to the lore and disappoint (Rings of Power, Halo, could name more) but I was very wrong. They incorporated numerous easter eggs and the same feel of the games. While they could have done a better job writing the villains to be in the grey area as seen in the games, they still did a fantastic job with the soundtrack, costumes, and mysteriousness.The actress for Lucy plays her role great and is not written as a mary sue who knows everything (im talking to you Disney) and Walton Goggins gives a memorable performance as the Ghoul.The show ends on a great cliffhanger on what is in store for season 2 and also leaves enough questions in every plot line to leave the viewer wanting more. Looking forward to whats in store!",10
Die hard fan of the game series,"Don't listen to the fanboy gatekeepers. This show wasn't perfect but it was awesome, and i expected far worse.Anybody with a brain knows it takes more than 1-2 episodes to have character development. Main character was likable, without being overpowered. Her luck stats were just high.She wasn't a Mary sue. She was the main character, the ""player character."" She starts off in basically a brainwashing cult, of course she's going to be naive. She grows and becomes more real. And remember it's only the first season, it takes time for people to change and break old habits.And god forbid a female actually have a sexual side without being criticized for it. I don't think it was necessary, but it was hardly interfering with the plot. I wasn't a fan of the romance aspect. But that's fine.That being said, max was awful. I kept rooting for him to die. I don't want redemption. They started his characters development far too late, and he's a psychopath.And of course everybody's favorite, Cooper. I could watch a whole show that just follows him around. He was such a fun morally gray character who was an over the top badass in the best ways. And I can't wait to see what they have in store for him. Give me the 200 years of backstory in a spinoff please.Lots of fun little Easter eggs and nods to the show, and actually having Matt berry show up was amazing.",9
If you love the game don't watch the show,"I don't even know where to begin the fact that it has an 8.7 rating blows my mind..
Obviously I'm assuming they were voted by people who never played the game... the wasteland is weak.. enclave is weak.. death claws are pretty cool I'll give them that.. but life in the wasteland doesn't translate from the game to the show at all ! I feel like if they were going to change so much they shouldn't have tried to follow the story line just make a new path! Instead of watching I would suggest just redownloading the game if you don't still have it and just replaying it because you will have a far better experience... In conclusion this show is hurting me on the inside and I'm sad that I waited so long to watch it :(...",
A mixed bag for me,"As my title suggest this is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I've played fallout for God knows how many times and absolutely love that game to pieces since then I've played new Vegas and fallout three but the less we say about 76 The better for me, the fallout TV such a show was a great opportunity And a lot of fun. It's best enjoyed if you turn off your brain and just have a good time with it and don't think too hard about the story. Unfortunately, as soon as you do think about the story you realise all the writing mistakes and plot errors and plot holes for that matter that start creep in. The show runners did a fantastic job bringing the wasteland to life and there are so many odds to the games that it's unreal. Unfortunately the end of the series just feels quite rushed and like I say the plot and the character motivations start to fall apart as soon as as you really think about them. The other thing that also irritates me is the number of conveniences within the story. Things just seem to happen at the right point and had it been for a few seconds either way these things wouldn't have happened. I appreciate that modern TV but it is annoying. This was a good show but it could've been a great show , a little bit like Westworld in that way series 2 is guaranteed but I have a feeling they will quickly lose his energy after series 2 in the same way that Westworld did.",6
Brilliant,"Wow, this is actually really good!I have to start my review by saying i never played the game so I entered with zero expectations, so im telling you when i binged this entire thing my mind was blown away. This is wonderfully done, shot, written and directed!First episode if you're like me unaware of the game wouldn't make a lot of sense, but when you go further you'll get attached to each character and the story itself. About the story, I've watched dozens of apocalyptic works and even games, not so much time ago the show Silo nearly had thhe same idea but surely different potentials. What I found interesting in Fallout is the philosophy about the apocalyptic world they're living in, how in an a capitalist society we well always end up like this, and the motivation behind each character to still live this awful life and their narratives is what singled out Fallout for me!",9
"Expected worse, but still disappointing","I wanted to give this series a much lower rating, but the overall production quality garners a few stars more. Walton Goggins helps the rating as well. However, you can tell this is a Bethesda take on the IP, and that's not a good thing. It's too clean, too playful. Fallout IS gritty and raw. The ""gory"" scenes in this even seem out of place, which is odd considering it's in the Fallout universe.Everyone seems to be praising the effects teams, and the majority of it is well done, but I'm a bit disappointed in the BoS power armor. For something that is not CGI, it looks like bad CGI. Not sure how that happens.If you only like Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, you'll probably like this. If you like Fallout 1, 2, and New Vegas, you'll probably just feel obligated to watch this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, well ignorance is bliss. I'm just surprised there wasn't micro transactions all along the way.",6
Mediocre. Maximus is a man-child.,An obvious product of handing it to multiple writers and directors and making it up as they went. Drastic tonal inconsistency between episodes and plots that take nonsense turns just to somehow justify how some character knows which way to go. The whole thing was improved for me significantly by skipping over all the Brotherhood of Steel stuff though because in the games I always found them obnoxious and sanctimonious and that's sure on point here. And Maximus is NOT a good person. I don't care how much they try to say it in the plot. Enjoy him NEVER not seeming like a whiny little boy. EVER. I honestly hate that characters guts.,5
Not a Fallout Player and i love it!!!!!!,"Amazon shows us that whenever they take things seriously they get the job done masterfully! Every episode is intriguing, every character, the acting is superb, you never feel any sign of monotony during your watch, you're always anxious waiting patiently and curious for what's coming next and they always surprise you with more and more insanity! Also, i believe, with: ""The Boys"", ""Peacemaker"" and this getting so much awareness, we can safely say, placing the 18+ tag on a movie/series is the best way to go! It allows the creators to capture reality at it's peak all the violence and gore so well done! Just go and watch it!!! Trust me, it's amazing!",10
A Must Watch for all Fallout Fans,"""Fallout"" is a gripping masterpiece that delivers on every level. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, this TV series expertly weaves together compelling storytelling, intricate character development, and breathtaking visuals. From the first episode to the last, you'll find yourself completely immersed in the richly detailed universe and the struggles of its inhabitants. With its clever blend of suspense, action, and thought-provoking themes, ""Fallout"" is a must-watch for any fan of dystopian dramas. Prepare to be hooked from start to finish. 10/10, without a doubt.If you loved the games, you will love this show for sure!",10
THIS IS AWESOME!!!,"Its a great series, especially with so many game to show or movie adaptations being so off the mark. Also knowing 1 guy had directional help with the series makes since. I hope that the series stays with the same integrity. I enjoyed this very much and am looking forward to the next season! I think the layout of the armor for the knights was fantastic. The use of miniatures to film was spectacular and the characters was spot on. I love the opening cinematics with the bombs going off. I am impressed with the camera angles and the wardrobe. Honestly the wardrobe department was amazing! The show feels very organic and a tribute to the game series.",10
From a lover of fallout games,I've been playing fallout games for as long as I've been alive from fallout new Vegas on the Xbox 360 to fallout 76 on my pc. Which is why I can confidently say this show does not disappoint it's fun and funny but also serious all the effects and props look great for a show and I'm happy there is more then enough content to keep me going with saying this I hope they make a season two and if they do I hope it's just as charming at this season. But for some people this show might feel slow at the start with the vault scenes or even boring or drawn out and to those people I say keep going it's worth it in the end.,10
A perfect adaptation,"The Fallout TV show is exceptional in every regard. Fantastic casting with memorable performances from every character. Kyle McLachlan, Lynch's constant muse, is used sparingly but his charisma makes every appearance entertaining. The wild west swagger of Walton Goggins terrifies & delights as The Ghoul/Cooper Howard. Ella Parnell plays protagonist Lucy with a wide eyed innocence that turns to steely determination. A mindset echoed by most players as the begin the first gaming experience of Fallout.The mise en scène is filled with so many tiny details, referencing brands items, weapons & so much more. Which makes the environments feel real & is a fun way to pop the fans of the franchise.The intriguing plot drives the whole endeavour forward, with genuine mystery that'll have you binging the series like you've got uranium fever.",10
My second ever review,"I don't really write reviews, I'm a lurker. But I grew up with Fallout and I have somewhat dreaded what this series could end up being. I did not like Fallout 4. I ignored Fallout 76. But I shall speak my piece for those who care to partake.First, I have some issues with the presentation visually. It feels quite plastic. There are parts that feel so CGI that it grinds my gears. Secondly, some character choices seem convenient rather than logical. Thirdly I would have liked further development of some.But in the end I surrender. They did this the way it should be done. This show does Fallout in a way that games as a medium should not, they actually made a show that added to the universe in a pleasant way. I'm not here to spoil anything, so I won't elaborate further. But if you like the games, and we're talking 1 to New Vegas, you should se this. At least, you should know that you needn't woory about doing so.Yeah. It's the bomb.And I had a blast.",8
Where Did All the Screenwriters Go?,"Far and away the best part of this 8-Part series is the first 15 minutes of Episode 1, but as realistic as they attempted to make the nuclear blasts seem, they still got that all wrong. And it was all downhill from there. I kept waiting for an intriguing plotline to develop from the several parallel stories presented, but no such luck. Alot of the set design on the surface had the feel of a low budget Mad Max film, and the scenes inside the vault played like big budget MST3K episode. Walton Goggins provided the only character of any discernable depth, and frankly provided the only dialogue in the whole eight-part series that was worth a damn. The rest of the characters were pretty much idiots. I can see from the other reviews that the series was a somewhat faithful adaptation of the video game, but that just tells me we need to stop using video games as source material for films and TV. 6/10.",6
First 10/10 I've given on IMDb,"Not that I'm a professional reviewer or anything, I just like good tv shows and movies and can usually find a small thing or two that I don't like about them.For Fallout, I've got nothing. It really is a masterpiece. I never played the fallout games either so I'm not fanboying or having nostalgia here, but after watching the show I can see why people loved the games.I've already read some articles and watched some youtube videos about Fallout lore because I'm hooked on this atomicpunk setting / scenario. What a cool concept, where nuclear energy develops faster than things like TVs and appliances, and a nuclear war actually happens, and now they're living in the aftermath. I could read about it for hours.Even standing alone from the preexisting lore and knowledge that they were working with from the games, the show is really well done. The acting was top notch, Walton Goggins and Ella Purnell were fantastic. The story is super interesting, the show looks awesome, even the end credits are pretty dope. They do a great job early on of setting the two different tones between the vaults and the wasteland, then have the pacing timed perfectly for giving more information about the characters, the world, and the plot.I think you get it now, this show rocks. Go watch it.Can't wait for season 2!",10
Another review after reading other reviews.,"The audacity of some of you to say oh no political messages in the show. Such a funny show. Wonderful. Thank you. You're the reason we have nothing good. Please rave about this show that included a genocidal freak. The second ign said omg what a show so honest to the source material. I should've known. Please stop ruining people lives like come on. Swear. Some of us work day in day out, study day in day out. I just want to watch something good for once. Please stop it. This horrible. Like botttom of the barrel. I hate it when they try to write bad characters. Like why. Stop it. No plot. No story. Nothing. I'm done.",7
Failed to capture the essence!,"It's like the writers watched a playthrough of the game and took notes. The characters who stood out the most from the writers perspective are the main characters in the show. It's like they're trying to imitate the game without understanding the true essence of the Fallout series.A true fan perspective. I tried liking the show. My problem with the show is with the writing. The writers have decided to take the show in a kid friendly direction. The entire vibe of the Fallout series is lost. The main characters are a bit too silly. The environment appears a bit too clean. The color palette a bit too saturated. It's easy to tell that they're acting on set and in front of props rather than in real rundown neighborhoods, subways, and walking inside of abandoned buildings not knowing what to expect around every corner etc. Everything that happens in the show is predictable from a mile away. That sense of suspense gone. Therefore, the sense of realism and immersion lost to the audience.The Fallout series is meant to be more in the vein of 1981 ""Escape from New York"", 2010 ""The Book of Eli"", 2007 ""I Am Legend"" apocalyptic, suspenseful, gritty, etc. But the writers of the show have decided to go in the direction of kid friendliness. It's like watching Power Rangers lol. Maybe it's not the writers who is at fault here, but rather the higher ups over at Microsoft. Either way, unfortunate.By the way, those thumbing this tv series up doesn't seem to have been fans of the Fallout series. I am seeing comments from causals who were never fans of the games thumbing this tv series up, and thus the reason for the high ratings. Maybe, that's the audience Microsoft was aiming for.",1
Great adaptation with some goofs,"There are many things done right in this show - the casting, the story, the attention to the details, the following of the already developed concepts and ideas. Take, for instance, one of the main characters of the show: the power armor; it's designed to look and behave just as in the games, so it has a real feel of a heavy force and slow-but-lethal feel to it (also, seeing Kyle MacLachlan in it is a sheer treat) - and there's many similar concepts taken ""as they were"": robotics, vaults, suits, guns, medication etc.Speaking of the story, it is perhaps not the most engaging one overall, but at the same time it's only the first season, and it's also engaging enough.Speaking of actors and characters, I think everyone's great and right where they belong in this show - I wouldn't focus the attention on anyone in particular as I think the whole ensemble is what really gets it going. And a special thanks to the people who built (or animated) the power armour - if I were to dedicate the praise to one character, that'd be it.With all the greatness, there's a surprising number of goofs: endless rounds in a six-shooter guns, lack of lights on power armours (when even pip-boys have them), unclear difference between some vaults etc. It doesn't spoil the show, but it's odd given it's based on video games where all these aspects are at the core of the gameplay/storytelling.Overall, I've enjoyed the show - it's gory, cooky, bizzare, infantile, peculiar and vivid. It's great.",8
This era of great video game adaptations!,"For video games adapted to movies or shows, I usually have extensive knowledge as I am a fan of the game itself. Fallout is different as I have not ever played the games. This meant that this show was a unique experience for me as I was now coming in from a non-fan perspective. Does this show succeed in pulling in newcomers?Firstly, the world itself is interesting. The post-apocalyptic world is visually stunning thanks to the phenomenal cinematography. They managed to capture a weirdly unfound beauty of the world but also contrast this with the ugly nature of human beings. We see how humans on the surface survive through these towns or the cruel activities they do. We also see factions such as the Brotherhood who try for some order on the surface and people who become ghouls after becoming mutated by the radiation. The monster designs are creepy and disgusting which is what makes them great. Some humans have also survived by going into vaults underground. The mystery behind the vaults is a big part of this show and kept me guessing about the meaning all the time. The lore in Fallout is captivating but never feels like information overload.The story also does a great job of juggling multiple character plots. Our central character Lucy MacLean, who is played wonderfully by Ella Purnell, goes to the surface to rescue her dad after their Vault is attacked. The premise is simple but the execution is well done. The series starts as a fish out of water story for Lucy but gradually becomes something different as more mysteries are uncovered. We also have a story about Maximus who is sent on a quest from the Brotherhood to receive a man. There is also The Ghoul, played amazingly by Walton Goggins, who is now a gunslinger also on a quest for the same man. Additionally, Norm MacLean is discovering a dark secret about their vault. All these characters and different plotlines occur in the show but they managed to balance all of it out while keeping all of them engaging. The writing and the dark humour are all great. I love that none of the characters are one dimensional and they all have quite the depth to them. Lucy isn't a badass and is an overly naive idiot. Her growing as she spends more time in the wasteland feels natural. The others also have great character arcs.The production designs of the sets are amazing. It is clear that a lot of effort went into building them and being as practical as well. It is also very notable that they filmed a lot on location which makes the show feel more real. They could easily just use green screen or CGI for a lot of the show but they didn't and I appreciate that. For example, the Brotherhood power armour is an actual practical suit and looks awesome. The rest of the costumes are also wonderfully designed from the Vault suit to the dirty look of those on the surface. Special praise should also come to the practical makeup of The Ghoul's face which honestly should win awards because it looks amazing. The music score by Ramin Djawadi for the show is very good. He uses excellent 50s and 60s songs for the right moment. He also composes a nice score that doesn't feel overly distracting. The score for whenever The Ghoul appears is honestly terrific! The violence in the show is grim and maybe a little gratuitous but it adds to the charm of the show.I don't have many flaws to say about this show apart from nitpicks. The second half of the show, except the finale, is a little weak compared to the first half. We don't get any cool action sequences and the story goes on a slight side quest detour for some characters that doesn't amount to much. The dialogue is also a little on the nose and a bit overly silly for the second half. I also kind of wish we got to see more monsters on the wasteland. We get two great monster encounters in the first half of the show but the second half just doesn't have any.Overall, Fallout is the next in amazing video game adaptations. When you have a show written by someone who seems to respect the games and the fans, you get Fallout. Not only did they write a show that pleases fans but also one that can bring in newcomers like me. I barely have any knowledge of the games, yet I was thoroughly entertained by this show. I can't wait for season 2! Heck, maybe I should get into the games for once.",9
One of the most fun alternative timelines relative to ours,"I love alternative history, and Fallout depicts a sinister but fun timeline in the best way possible. This is now my favorite show and first the first show that got me to write a review.The show takes you into the fallout universe, it is immersive and detailed. For those that love a post apocalypse scene this is one you cannot miss. Costumes, scenes etc are all primo.However what sets this show apart for me is its depiction of good and evil or lack there of. All morality is based on instinct and is subject to change with respect to a societies environment. We are all natural born killers, we just don't need to kill yet.I put it up there with interstellar, the big lebowski, and co. Makes me think of endless AI generated content in the future and how I wouldnt leave my house if there were endless seasons of Walter Goggins flashbacks.",10
Unexpected gem,"With all game adaptations you go in holding your breath and expecting the worst but this doesn't disappoint at first you can see it becoming another mundane experience. This is soon proven otherwise as you're plunged into the world of fallout with gritty conflict and a complex plot my only complain is the lack of content in such a large universe of lore they've filled a lot of it with walking and some ""Easter eggs"", they have set up an enjoyable show as well as the base to continue a successful video game adaptation which makes a nice change. Hopefully this will have a promising future and explore more of the fallout lore and some of the niche characters.",9
A Must-Watch Show That Rocks,"""Fallout"" is not your average TV series - it's way cooler than that. Imagine a world where everything got messed up by nuclear bombs, and people are living in underground bunkers to stay safe. But when they have to come up to the surface, they find a wild place full of mutants and scary people doing bad things.The main character, Lucy, played by Ella Purcell, is new to this topside world and totally unprepared for what she finds. And let's not forget about Walton Goggins, who plays this awesome mutant bandit. He steals the show every time he's on screen!What's really neat about ""Fallout"" is how it looks and feels just like the video game. It's like someone who really knows the game made a movie out of it, which is pretty amazing, especially in 2024.The humor, the story, the music - it's all there, making ""Fallout"" a total blast to watch. And Lucy? She's not your typical ""strong woman"" character. She's cool and easy to like, just like the rest of the cast.So, if you're looking for a show that's exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat, ""Fallout"" is the one. And hey, Amazon, if you're listening, forget about ""Rings of Power"" and give us more ""Fallout"" instead!",8
Surprisingly good for a video game adapted TV show,"Don't know how to put it, but Fallout really did take me by surprise. Being a big Fallout fan, I honestly was a bit skeptical to see how Todd Howard could try to not adapt the games into this story and instead go with a whole new story that goes differently than the OG games or the Bethesda titles. But I kinda like it.The goods. First, the characters are actually well developed. Lucy, out main character, is quite charming and enjoyable to follow along as she tries to look for her father whom as taken from her in the Vault (Fallout 3 copy?). She does see the world outside in a more positive outlook in life, as a naïve Vault Dweller would, but would soon see it differently.The Ghoul was another great ensemble to the characters. A once TV star that has endured the 200 years above ground and is now a bounty hunter that is also at risk of turning feral. It's also great that we have flashbacks of his past before the Great War.Another great highlight is the story itself. Suffice to say it has everything a good story should have, plus the humor and charm that the Fallout games possess. Music, aesthetic, and of course, the whole plot with the Vaults like in any other Fallout game.The only thing I would've loved to see was more backstory on the NCR and what happened to the rest of them when Shady Sands was destroyed. But crossing my fingers season 2 will tap into the New Vegas lore.I would say Fallout is a great TV show to watch. And it's one thing that actually works in the minds of Todd Howard.",9
A Fresh Start to the End of the World,"Fallout is depressingly dystopian. Of course, that is as it should be: it's the end of the so-called civilised world. Strangely, while it's tempting to make comparisons of the world before and after the atomic apocalypse, in the case of the Fallout universe, it's more tricky.Malevolence just seems more overt post apocalypse; otherwise, perhaps it's not so different. Perhaps pre-apocalypse, the darkness in people just hid more effectively in the shadows; later, there was no need for it to be hidden.Again, because Fallout gamers and neophyte non-gamer viewers will bring entirely different expectations to their viewer experiences, the storyline has to try to accommodate both. The latter viewer will probably bring an initially confused, and understandably naive perspective in their viewing of Vault Tec curated realities.They're (newbie viewers) are likely to accept the suggestion of a utopian-like pseudo way of life (within a vault fallout shelter), away from apocalyptic horror and radiation hazard. We learn, eventually, what the vaults are, in truth. It turns out, vaults are not so benevolent in their design intent. Rather, the idea behind their development, the reason for which they were built, may be something quite horrific. Outside and inside mayn't be so different.So, depending on whether you're new to the Fallout universe or not, viewer expectations, accordingly, are likely to be quite different. Graphic violence, tribal power struggles, mutated horrors, and the near complete devolution of humanity, all offer an unsavoury tableau of human woe and depravity. This is the textured palette with which the creators have to work.As a result, I found myself a little disappointed the first series didn't progress further than it did, story wise. However, the reality is, many viewers are new to the concepts and ideas of the Fallout universe. So that's just the way it is.",7
In love with it,"From the beginning you can see the references to the game, how she describes her abilities, game objects, it is very integrated into the series. The story is as elaborate as the games, you feel that it is a story, an opening for a new fallout, for fans of the game who do not stop fantasizing about a new version, it is the best they could have given us.Characters with different personalities and interests, I loved Walton and Kyle, they are too charismatic, There is a lot to know about them and that is what I like about the series, it explains everything but the characters are so deep that with all of them you want to know more, everything in the series is worth it. Waiting for the second season!",9
Its good but.....,"The world is very well represented. The look and the feel of the show takes me to the game and I give it 10 stars for that. But characters (maximus] are too unrealistic. Which I think was done to make the lead Lucy look smarter. She is a good character, she didn't need the help. It took away from the show in the end. I hope to see positive growth in the male characters in the second season. I also would like to see more of the common creatures of the waste land that are in the games. The game has so many great stories in it that could be included in the show
. I would love to see that Japanese ship captain come to life.",7
NOPE,"Twisted. Bloody. Violent. And dark. There is good left in our world, but this isn't it.First, this story line is nothing new. Spoiler alert: the evil in the world had finally outdone itself and destroyed itself. All that has survived are a few remnants of humanity... blah, blah, blah.Maybe you need to be a sold out fan of this game to look past how worn out this storyline is. Nope, this is not for me.Next, twisting up sex with murder in a way that tries to make light of the murder-even make fun of it-just perpetuates that kind of evil that destroyed this science fiction world to begin with.It's not believable.It's not funny.It's not original.What is it?It's a waste of time.",2
Just a Ghoul and his dog,"Movies based on games just don't work out. They tried it with WOW and D&D and got a few die-hards to watch them once.But Fallout has hit the JACKPOT! This is just such a well thought out story with just the right amount of flashbacks thrown in just when you need them so it doesn't give away too much of the plot.And the acting is superb. Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten make a great team and lighten the mood when they aren't kicking butt. Walt Goggins is superb as usual with that smile that says trust me when you know you can't. And Leslie Uggams - perfect.That said, it is not a show for everybody. If you are squeamish, find something else to watch. There are a LOT of gross scenes which you should expect after a nuclear holocaust has occurred. Human behavior hasn't changed much. The Haves want more and the Have-nots just want something but don't know what's there. Sort of a Mad Max meets The Walking Dead.I never played any of the video games in the long storied franchise but others have said it has stayed true to the games in the feel and context so I'm guessing that some of the producers played or watched others play the game to capture that feeling.Just be careful. You may want to binge watch the whole series at once and it is pretty intense.",9
Outstanding tv!,"I never played the game, so was hesistant to watch. As it seems Hollywood has run out of its own original ideas and is now plugging every game franchise it can get it grubby little fingers on.But what a great watch, I mean excellent. The reason I tuned into it was because of Walton Goggins. He is such a skilled actor, that I have admired for so long. This is another fantastic feather in his ever increasing legendary cap.The story is well thought out, though has a parallel story arc as the Resident Evil plotline (The whole insider job blahblahblah!!), but its great tv.Every episode highly entertaining, theres something just fantastic about the mix of 1950s music & apocalyptic mayhem. I think that it was Silent Hill that first introduced Johnny Cash back into the mix, when it comes to thrillers and 50s music.Anyway loved it! Bring on season 2, I just hope Nolan doesn't drag this series out like he did for Westworld.",8
Jonathan Nolan always delivers,"This series is great! Watching it made me want to play the Fallout games all over again, specially Fallout New Vegas, a favorite of mine. The scenery is beautiful, the main characters are interesting, most of the time, specially Lucy, the vault dweller. The script is engaging and it shows all the things that whoever likes the game, will also enjoy on the series. But the main reason I wanted to watch this series is because of Jonathan Nolan. Loved his other projects, such as Person of Interest and Westworld, and he is a good sci-fi series creator.Summarizing, this series is worth the watch and worthy of your time to check it out.",9
Time is the ultimate apex predator,"The film opens in 1958 when LA is suddenly nuked. It then jumps 279 years later. There exists an idyllic society that lives in carefully planned vaults. Vault 33 looks like it was inspired from the underground society in the cult classic ""A Boy and His Dog."" It appears to pay homage to the film by showing a poster of a film titled, ""A Man and His Dog."" Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins) was a cowboy star during the Red Scare era. He survives years later as a ghoul. Outside raiders disrupt the lives of those in the vault. Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell) becomes our naive protagonist as she leaves the safety of the vault to come the surface in search of her kidnapped father. Along the way she meets Maximus (Aaron Moten) a soldier of the brotherhood. They have similar goals and combine resources.This was a fun series regardless of all the science issues. This should be sci-fi fantasy. It leaves at a point that promises for a revenge filled second season.Guide: F-word, sex, and nudity (but not too much)",10
Fallout player here,"This show is so much like the game. I was worried about it not being a good, but it's absolutely amazing. I'm usually not one to write reviews, but I just had to on this one. The music the setting the characters create such an amazing atmosphere, that completely depicts the same vibe as call out the video game. I recommend watching this, even if you have or have not played a video game because it is absolutely amazing. I gave it a 10 out of 10 because I can't wait for the second season and after watching it I'm sure you will not be able to wait as well. I promise you I will not regret a binge watching this.",10
Best Video game adaption yet,"Season 1:
Fallout has a particular flavor when it comes to post apocalyptic tales. Luckily, the show captured it perfectly. The aesthetic was perfect. I felt like I was in the fallout world. You could tell from the junk in the background and the uniforms and the way the armor looked. Whoever did the set design did their homeworkThe tale of these three characters are great. The characters are very still developed and have great character arcs.This does a lot of fan service to the people who played the games. If you like sci-fi, post apocalyptic things and/or wacky dark humor you might like this, but if you're more of a casual show watcher, this might not be for you.But there wasn't a lot to complain about. The ending was okay, but kinda meh. The journey was great but the way it was tied up was not great imo.I didn't like the liberties they took with some aspects of the lore but I understand this is an adaptation, not a copy of the video games on a different medium.All in all, I enjoyed the ride. I can't wait for season two.",8
Too much like the video game,"Immersive and thrilling, this film boasts impressive CGI, a captivating story line, and an intriguing mystery that keeps viewers hooked from start to finish. However, despite its many strengths, there's a noticeable disparity in the acting department. While the CGI elements excel in creating a visually stunning world, some performances feel reminiscent of the characters in video games rather than genuine portrayals. The story, though engaging, could have been elevated with more authentic and natural acting, allowing viewers to fully immerse themselves in the post-apocalyptic setting, it's better that than remind people that they are watching an adaptation of an oldish video game. While this flaw may not be immediately apparent to all viewers, it detracts from the overall experience and prevents the film from achieving its full potential. Nonetheless, for fans of action and suspense, this movie still offers an enjoyable ride through its dystopian landscape.",6
"Gamers familiar with the franchise will likely appreciate it, while newcomers might need a few episodes to grasp what Fallout is all about, but they'll likely end up loving it","If you're a fan of the Fallout video game series, you'll likely enjoy this series and eagerly anticipate its continuation after watching. However, for those unfamiliar with the Fallout games, their reaction might be uncertain, as certain aspects may not be fully understood. It's recommended they approach it as a sci-fi or cyberpunk series. Despite being episodic, the first episode captivated me, leading to a binge-watch of the entire series. The storyline progressively improves, and the main characters are very engaging. Fans of conspiracy theories may find this series particularly appealing as I did.",8
"Fallout, Fallout always changes.","Let me start with the technical stuff: I think the creators of this show did an amazing job at nailing the Fallout look and vibe. That goes way beyond just presenting some random props fans might know from the games. We see the classic Fallout world of 50' US aesthetics with early 80' technology grafted over futuristic inventions. And then we see how that world might look like after a nuclear war and 200 years of decay. So far, so good. It indicates a certain level of reverence for the source material.However, this still isn't the Fallout world we know from the video games and that is a surprising constant in the entire Fallout series. Fallout always has two main components. One is what might be called the ""nameless evil of the day"". So in the first Fallout games that nameless evil was government overreach and conspiracies. In following Fallout games that nameless evil was science ""gone wrong"" and the bigoted cancer of irrational cults. With this TV show that nameless evil is the selfish corporate interest of mega-companies having their own twisted social agendas.The other component is the eternally flawed human nature and how even the best of intentions, when confronted by our craving for power and our desire to impose our wills on others, will eventually corrupt any cause we deem worthy and good.This mix of components is thrown into a dystopian future and the appeal of the Fallout world is that it lets us decide what is the true evil. Is it the lawlessness and cruelty of the world we see or is it the nameless evil which shaped this world?That is where the show has its problems. We are rushed through this weighing of alternatives at such a pace that there is very little room for reflection. We barely get to know the main characters before we are neckdeep in the conspiracy pervading this strange future. In a way it feels like the writers were so afraid of appearing like just another generic mystery box TV show that they revealed their mystery way too early.That being said, it's a good TV show. I just fear that they tried to tell too much too fast for it to be a great show. Maybe a potential second season will take a deep breath, slow down a bit and develop its protagonists better.",
Worth a look,"I've only played Fallout 4, so I am not a fanboy of the game from the first release like so many people are. Still, the series did not disappoint. The first thing I thought when I saw this was the Art Director deserves an Emmy. The place looks exactly like the video game. The cities, the towns, the abandoned buildings are right out of the video game. The Art Director did a masterful job in creating a wasteland of destroyed cities.Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins were terrific. The reason I didn't give the series an 8 or 9 star review is because of one character, Maximus/Titus. I didn't like his storyline, and I especially didn't like the actor, I thought he was terrible. He always has this forlorn, sad look on his face, and he always whined. I just didn't like him at all especially the attempts at humor. Goggins on the other hand was terrific as usual.For those who don't know about the game, we are in a ""Mad Max"" type environment after a nuclear war has almost completely destroyed civilization. We have people living in underground vaults hoping to repopulate the Earth one day after whatever is left on the surface has died. But the surface dwellers aren't too keen on dying out just yet. We have various factions of all the different groups and of course radioactive monsters. The story is done bascially in two different perspectives. We experience the present while remembering the past and how the world got where it is today. It tells how and why the vaults were built and how we came to war. Accompanying our protaganists is a sound track made up of mostly 1940s and 1950s songs. It's fine for a while but they overdo it a bit.All in all, I think this was a very good series and I can envision at least 3 more seasons. I highly recommend this series.",7
Quite disappointing,"Too much bad acting. Way to much music in almost every scene. A messy plot. Not enough action. Monsters that are not nearly as dangerous as in the games, and are killed easily. For instance a gulper that is simply killed by dragging a man out of its mouth. I didn't really understand how that was possible at all to kill a big scary monster like that. The main characters do a decent job trying to make the series interesting, but many of the other characters are simply bad actors. A lot of scenes are confusing and a lot of questions about why the characters do what they do or say what they say are left unanswered. The good thing about the whole thing is the visuals and the environment, that is very true to the game series. But that's about it. Maybe I expected too much. But it felt like a less than mediocre Nuka cola.",4
Awsome Adaption,"This adaptation, takes some big swings. It captures the essence of the games - the dark humor, the retro-futurism, the brutal world - but the execution isn't always smooth.Nailed the Tone: The show perfectly blends the series' signature dark comedy with genuine post-apocalyptic grit. Expect laugh-out-loud moments alongside moments of genuine horror.World Building: The California wasteland feels lived-in and dangerous, filled with familiar (and mutated) creatures and callbacks to the games' lore.Strong Cast: The characters are engaging, with the protagonist's wide-eyed innocence a great counterpoint to the jaded wasteland veterans.",9
Fantastic for gamers and nongamers alike,"FalloutFallout, based on the successful video game franchise produced by Bethesda, does a great job of capturing the atmosphere of Fallout 3, specifically. Like the game, the audience is thrust into a world where you don't quite know what's going on.Nuclear war has taken place, and a small percentage of humanity live in vaults, safe from the radiation. The goal is to wait out the ""fallout"" from the bombs and go back to the surface. When the leader of vault 33 is kidnapped, his daughter bravely goes to the surface to find that nothing she believed was true.In the 200+ years since the bombs fell, not everyone was put into vaults, and a form of lawlessness has fallen over California. Bounty hunters, scavengers and a military Brotherhood fights to survive the horrors that continue.As in most video games, a magic item or person or prophecy suddenly appears, and getting from point A to point B becomes the ultimate goal. But don't forget side quests. That's where you learn the most information, of course!For fans of the game, they did a great job with the visuals and the storytelling. For those who had no idea what was happening, they also did a great job unfolding the mysteries of the past, present, and alluding to a future. The show did leave it open for a second season, and I truly hope one is created.I won't spoil anything as this is brand new, but I recommend it as a good science fiction, post apocalyptic and a questionable morality experience. The reasons behind the war, and everything after, are a bit of a stretch, though.",9
Pleasantly Surprised,"I often find it difficult to remain engaged in a TV series. Most I put down after watching either the first few episodes or sometimes even just the first episode.That wasn't the case here. I played the games, and decided to watch with family that hadn't. And it had a bit of everything. You were always wondering what was going to happen next. It was weird - in a good way. Even for someone like me in having played the games before, they throw in new storylines and ways of setting the scene that capture what makes Fallout Fallout in its own unique way.Highlight was the music - both the composed pieces and licenced songs. Seriously there is nothing quite like this series. Do give it a chance.",9
"Hands down, the best video game adaptation I've ever seen","I love the Fallout game series. I have been playing them for decades. I love the post-apocalyptic world. I love the back story and glimpses into the past. I've always said the Fallout world would make a great movie or TV show. But, if the past is any indication, it would not do the games justice. Except this series. I was blown away by the attention to detail. It's like they mirrored the game to the screen. I felt like I was playing another iteration of my favorite franchise. Story was a bit slow in the beginning, but quickly picked up the pace. Love the bits of humor thrown in just like the games. But also is equally dystopian in all it's glory. Would love more of Inon Zur's original music from the games, there is a taste of it here and there, but I would love to hear more. With all the positive feedback, I am confident this will get picked up for more seasons. Keep em coming, I love it.",9
Great Fallout Atmosphere,"The premise of Fallout is very disturbing and dark, but the writers did a magnificent job of balancing that with humor. In fact, I would say how they handled the dark with the light is the best part of this series.Fallout must be gory, edgy, profane, and disgusting. Some are put off by that, but that is the Fallout world. Those who have played the games know that well. The producers did a good job presenting that world. The contrast between vault dwellers and the above-grounders was well crafted.The characterizations, for the most part, were good. The costuming was excellent. The settings and attention to details was very good. This is one of those series where the cost of production can skyrocket within just a few seasons and likely cause it to be canceled. But I hope we can get several seasons before that happens.",9
Just plain Fun!,"Completely unfamiliar with the video game, have followed Wade's career however, and as usual he delivers carrying the heart and soul of the series.No spoilers here.Good old fashioned classic tale, sorta Good vs. Evil, but who actually are the good guys or the bad guys?The authors do a great job engaging their politics within the scenery set designs and experiences of the individual characters as opposed to preaching and ramming silliness down the viewers throats.They present a most unforgiving world, which removes a lot of modern silly wokeness and pronouns when survival is the base necessity...
They show that stuff gets tossed to the wayside... in season 1 anyhow..
This Allows the viewer to make up their own inferences and ideas as the story kinda S L O W L Y unfolds.Yes, I get it... ya'll be watchin' and flippin' through your phones... but the story eventually begins to move along and percolate nicely, into a good old mystery...Gorgeous set designs and use of classic music in the first few episodes to beautifully exemplify the disparity of their past vs. The future we and they are presented with... The entire production is beautifully stylized, the film, the costumes, the plot oh MY!Every detail in their world is superbly presented which makes the world presented believable!Every actor do their characters justice..
all skilled, from bit players to scene stealers, they give their characters depth and we can feel their desperation in such an unforgiving world.Ate season one UP like popcorn!!Looking forward to an engrossing story line, so sit back, open your mind and get carried away into a fun filled action packed distopia!Rod Sterling would be proud!",9
Picks up at the end,"The adaptation of the universe in which it takes place is close to perfect! The locations are spot on and it definitely feels like fallout. The main characters are mostly great, with a few exceptions, and the story is ok. All in all it feels like the show finds it pace and the characters feels settled in the last couple of episodes. It bodes great for the second season!There are however a few things that don't sit right with me, the major thing being the ghouls in the games have always been explained by radiation, but in the show people are made into ghouls by a some concoction.All in all a good show worth seeing even if you've never played the games!",7
"One of the best shows I have seen in a long time, but the Maximus character confuses me.","I'm really enjoying this show, I only have one and a half episodes left.I don't have much knowledge of the game, but as the show goes , it is way better than most shows coming out nowadays.I love that this show is not afraid to show character flaws and they do a good job of showing how ppl turn out based off life experiences. It is refreshing to see characters that have to over come adversity. It is a very much needed break from what Hollywood has done to female leads and their male counter parts in the last few years.The only character/ issue that I am having is Maximus. It took me a while to pinpoint what bothered me about the character, and I think it's the fact that he reminds me of a confused and angry teenager that is just now learning the ways of the world. His emotions go back and forth too much for me and his actions don't feel consistent. It doesn't help that I can't for the life of me figure out how old he is supposed to be. I assumed he was a 45 to 50 year old man when he was first introduced, this gave me a certain expectation in behavior, so I was caught off guard when he started acting the way he did, he seemed bitter, immature, and naive at times, brave sometimes , but other times a complete coward, they tried to make him look like a good guy, but his actions said otherwise.Anyway, I just found out that he is 34 in real life so he was probably 33 when he filmed.. I guess I'll find out for sure how old he is once I watch the last 2 episodes.Other than that, I'm loving the show, and the whole Maximus thing doesn't bother me too much, but it does take me out of the show every now and then.",8
they left loot behind,"Firstly, and this applies to the games as well, 200 years is way too far-fetched. Industrialized civilizations could have risen twice-over. It gives me the impression the games, and thus this show, were originally designed for 20 years after the war. Enough time for a post-war generation to reach adulthood and entropy to catch-up to vault-dwellers, but then some seagull flew in and went ""no, make it TWO HUNDRED YEARS!!"", but by then it was too late to change all the artwork. So mentally knock a zero off that number and it'll go-down more easily.Ayways, the show is a mild dark comedy set in a fantasy retro-future, but a little slow at times, a little sparse with the comedy.Lucy worked well as a sheltered vault-dweller and she evolves over the series. Maximus is an interesting flawed character, not likable but clearly has some growing-up to do. Howard is Cad Bane. Dogmeat had way more personality than in the game, but they missed a golden opportunity with the booby-traps (searh: goddamn it dogmeat)... maybe next season.The Brotherhood were well portrayed, though they kinda glossed over the purity thing, and having a lame old-man in-charge didn't quite fit with their might-is-right ideology. Vault dwellers were a bit too hammy, not enough internal farce & own-goals as suggested by the games. We don't see much of the Enclave or other factions.There's only one robot, and there are no orcs (aka super-mutants), which is probably for the best given the current state of vfx. Mr Gutsy was sorely missed, as was some of the vicious anti-communist rhetoric from the games. Also missing was the all-important looting. Not looting a corpse naked is a bit of a Fallout faux pas, likewise not carrying-off the entire contents of a lair.The story is pretty tiresome: yet another daddy-issues production (I often wonder why Americans pump-out so many of these). There's some mystery surrounding the vaults and a certain raider, but with the usual predictable we're the baddies outcome. The games had similar problems, but at least there you could completely ignore it to do your own thing, especially Fallout4 (2014). Here we're forced to ride along Lucy's linear monothreaded quest for her dad, which in itself didn't feel compelling as we don't know much about either of them, even by the end. The story of Maximus was more interesting as his mistakes & lies start to snowball into a Flashmanesque victory, but again we really don't know enough about the character to care that much. Bane was more fleshed out, but so at odds with his pre-war persona, will be interesting to see how/why he became so cruel. I suspect Lucy's dad represents an amalgam the player from the different games, given the trail of destruction in his wake.Besides the excellent robot, Vfx here was pretty distracting, like early 00's BSG cylons distracting. Milky cataract compositing, white skies, softglows, poorly animated power-armor, unfinished gulpers and the deep dark abyss of Howard's gaping nose-hole. After witnessing all of this I go back to look at Transformers (2007 - seventeen years ago) and lament: ""what happened to you vfx, you used to be beautiful"".Sets were mostly great, but ruined by the cg in many cases. Lighting was all over the place, from natural sunlit to overcast to stage lit, sometimes in the same sequence. There were no radstorms. Costumes & props were nowhere near as good as those in Fallout4, some of the BG & minor characters looked like cosplayers, and quite a few were well-fed & indoorsy.Music was either great (historical recordings) or forgettable (the rest). The scene with the 'music critics' was hilarious.",6
Could have been so much better,"The potential of the Fallout property is huge and this series is marred with poor writing, visual fx, timing, and acting.I've been a fan of the games for a long time and had immediate mixed feelings upon discovering a series was in the works. On the one hand, I was excited to be pulled back into the post-apocalyptic, war torn wasteland and reintroduced to my favourite characters and creatures. However, I immediately understood this could be another cash grab series, designed to meet the bare minimum for fans and simultaneously draw in a larger audience of new admirers. After watching the first season, the latter has been confirmed.There's are many times the dialogue is uninteresting and poorly timed, only exasperated by the lacklustre acting. The fight scenes are rubbish and remind me of a 1950s budget movie where the punches are feet away from the target. Moreover, the vfx and staging are so uninspired, it feels you're watching actors on a set.It does not feel like a show set in the Fallout universe.I would much rather no series at all than this poor excuse of a Fallout show.",3
Brought me back to that world......,"For someone who spent a thousand hours in the game on console and VR, this series brought me back. Thanks for making this great! The characters, the chems and stims, the products, the comfort of the vault and question of why things are they way they are amounts to mind candy for me. I've watched it twice and will most likely go for a third round. Yeah the relationships between the characters were different but they made up for that with little gems like the vendor yelling dogmeat! The soundtrack had me singing along the whole time. More please and soon. Until then I'll be on my next play through crawling out through the fallout baby!",10
Absolutely loved it!,"Brilliant show, can't wait for more of it! True to the game series in terms of its story telling, character choices and humour! Like any long term fan I was concerned and skeptical it won't be as good as you hope but it certainly did not disappoint, really looking forward to how they expand on the world they have created in future seasons also looking forward to seeing how the characters develop over time and the introduction of more lore and easter eggs from the various game titles, no spoilers in this review want to say if you are a fan of the franchise you should absolutely watch this show! Highly recommended!",9
Its good but has some shortcomings,"Overall the show looks good and sounds good. The tone is perfect with all characters being ridiculous. I grew up with FO1 and FO2 and the show is more in line with later games but it's fineIt's starts to fast introducing everyone in 1st episode and then continues with weird cuts to different characters.The characters and not particularly likable with
except for Walton Goggins, he is great. Lucy is like a mormon that never seen and outside world - the problem is that it is rarely funny. Maximus on the other hand is not relatable, why does he do what he do - what people hurt him and what revenge he wants to tak. Perhaps it is a set up for later reveal but right now he is somehow bland - is he good, bad, opportunistic. He seems exactly like Star Wars black trooper who was there but is not remembered because he wasn't well written character or really relevant to the story.Some people complained that many game locations are absent or destroyed. I guess they are right, there is a missed opportunity for many references.Same with the Brotherhood / Enclave. Looks a bit like like both factions were merged into one, but perhaps, again, it is a set up for later seasons.One glaring aspect of the show is ultra violence. Its a trend lately (The Boys, Gen V, Invincible and probably more). The game was never so bloody (although there were occasional decapitations). It doesn't really add to the show that much.Fallout is a really well made adaptation, it capture many aspects of the game. Its just overall the show doesn't make you care about its characters. Character motivations are unconvincing. The Last of US show managed it better. But still I hope next Fallout season will be better.",8
Great! Even for the for a fallout super geek..,"I love the fallout franchise and have hundreds of hours of play time. The storyline and the lore is really what I find captivating about the whole franchise. I thought they did a great job on the series and for me, it's about the details which I felt they nailed. My only complaint is the story arc feels all over the place. It's fallout 76 meets elements of fallout 3, some new Vegas with fallout 4 storyline but in the desert. I was looking for something more connected to at least one of the game storylines. I love the characters, especially the ghoul, the ""serum"" Dr. Guy and of course Lucy. The flash forwards and then backwards admittedly are a bit hard to follow. I will have to watch it all over again so that I can ""get it"".",8
The Nolan Effect,"It's really wild to think that this would be the project that Jonathan Nolan would hang his hat on and say ""Hey now this! This is something!"" And throughout watching the season I couldn't quite tell if this was the product of someone who lived the games or Todd Howard himself, and it turns out it was Todd Howard himself. But to reduce this show down to a comparison to The Last of Us wouldn't do the show justice by any means. This takes the spirit of the games, along with its humor, and runs with it. Lisa Joy, Jonathan Nolan, and Co. Weave a such a well crafted season of television that it makes me ashamed to say I even doubted the duo that crafted the first season of Westworld. There's a world that I want to stretch a lawn chair out in and sit back with my Nuka Cola.Ella Purnells Lucy is a warm center to anchor this story in. Surrounded with excellent characters like Moises Arias' Norm and, of course, the selling point of the show. Walton Goggins' Ghoul of a character makes me want scream Yee Haw and run through the desert buck naked.I can't wait to see what happens with the rest of this shows life. Whether it suffer the fate of so many other Amazon Prime shows, or god forbid, befall the fate of a show like The Boys. I just hope we can revel in this fun world that the Nolan's have made for a good time. And hopefully a long time.Blu.",9
An entertaining series to binge. Gets better and better,"I've never played Fallout the game, I've heard of it but new nothing about its content.So I went into this series blind.Maybe for me that was the best way, as I can just enjoy it for what it is.Or maybe I'm missing little references from the game.But I can look those up and delve more into the lore.As for the TV show I can honestly say I'm impressed.The colours, feel and story were all top notch in tone.The acting from Walton Goggins meant he was perfectly cast as the Ghoul/Cooper and the duality of his character was brilliant.Ella Purnell was also superb in her role. No silly feminist politics just great action scenes and wide eyed wonder and bewilderment at what she was seeing and finding out.Give this show a try.Very entertaining.",8
I didn't play the game.,"I'm going to abstain from rating this title as I did not play the games and feel like a lot of the jokes, tone, and character dynamics may have been lost on me.From the perspective of a newcomer, the opening was a bit trite. I found all of the characters, dynamics and world building to be pretty boring, cringe inducing and otherwise unbelievable.Once they got through the adventure stage and actually started introducing the backstory is where it got interesting for me. The origins of the vaults, backstory regarding the main characters and the politics of the world added a lot of missing context which allowed me to actually invest in the story being told.I will definitely stay tuned for future seasons but have some grievances about the first season.The lack of consequence for those in dangerous and near death situations, the stupidly jovial disposition of the characters, the general stupidity and inconsistency in character choices all really strain ones ability to suspend disbelief.I feel like this may be an artifact left from the game as the unseriousness definitely seems deliberate, so I'm giving it a pass for now, even if - for me - it takes away from the series.The last couple of episodes really save the series so don't quit early.",
A good combination of black humor and drama,"This is a good-quality post-apocalyptic film adaptation of the game universe, filled with black humor and comical cruelty, so the film is recommended only for viewers over the age of 18. The fifth series stands out in particular, in which excellent directing and a well-developed script create an eccentric adventure of complex characters. The artists did a great job on the visual design, the visual effects are acceptable, and the characters are motivated and their conflicts are readable.The painted inhabitants of the wasteland may seem too plastic, as well as power armor, but the degree of discrepancy does not cause strong dissonance and you can put up with these conventions, because the series has an intriguing plot and voluminous characters. Each character is endowed with an individual character, background, beliefs - you sympathize with them and worry about them.However, it may seem to some viewers that the plot is too focused on personal drama, which is why the series sometimes sags on protracted explanations, which can cause fatigue. Despite this, the film can captivate with intriguing twists, and the atmosphere of the film corresponds to the game lore, which will appeal to fans, but, unfortunately, it does not immerse into the world of the apocalypse, does not convey the threat and struggle for survival, but entertains with bright colors and comical characters. The role of Walton Goggins, who created the colorful, hardened ""The Ghoul"", stands out in particular. Aaron Moten does not seem to me suitable for the image of a knight lover, in my opinion, the casting director should have looked for a more suitable actor: it is somewhat annoying to see his surprised face. Ella Purnell, who was chosen for the role of a resident of the asylum, plays reliably, she emotionally conveys the image of a woman whose worldview will change as the plot develops. In general, the picture was not bypassed by processing for compliance with the quotas of inclusivity and respect for racial diversity, but fortunately, the picture will not focus on gender guidelines.Before watching the movie series ""Fallout"", I was skeptical, but when I started watching, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of work on the script, bold jokes and a realistic look at the post-apocalyptic world. Although I am not a fan of the game, but only played in ""Fallout 3"", I accepted the world of the movie series without a doubt and gladly immersed myself in its atmosphere of radiation and the tragedy of human destinies.As I said, there is too much drama in the picture, from the controversial novice of the brotherhood to the hypocritical caretaker of the asylum. This tragedy, in my opinion, is overloaded, there is clearly not enough humor for balance. It is black humor that sets the crazy pace of post-apocalyptic fun, but it sags under the plot necessity - to build a structure of motives and goals. Rather, this is a feature of the series, not a disadvantage. It's very difficult to please or balance emotions, and I don't blame the authors - they did a good job, and this work is at a decent creative level.",7
The Curse is finally over,"Amazon delivers us a bombshell that finally puts a stop to the curse of failed video game adaptations just after HBO's Last of Us. Not being an inveterate fan of the Bethesda Studios franchise, the series captivated me from the first episode without letting me down until its excellent finale which leaves the way open for an eponymous season 2.The success of Fall Out lies in all its interesting characters and its world building between dark humor, retro futuristic and post apocalypse. A skewer of imperfect burnt heads but which gains in complexity as the story progresses. Whether you are a neophyte or a fan of the saga, you will never be lost because Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have succeeded in respecting the lore of the Game to the letter by sprinkling easter eggs all along the road but without destabilizing the new comer. A production of impressive quality in both form and substance and which positions itself as one of the big TV moment for 2024. Fan of Westerns, retro science fiction, slapstick comedy, conspiracy theory and video games, Fall out is everything listed above and much more. Grandiose.",9
Consistently Nostalgic Entertainment - Season 1 Review,"Capturing the essence of the hit video games from Bethesda Studios, season 1 of ""Fallout"" wisely didn't stray too far from the original look, feel, and vibe of this iconic and unnerving storyline.From the threat of nuclear war - something which we're facing today - to the actual manifestation of it, the series delivered on the high notes, or should I say mushroom clouds.The literal fallout of what would happen to society and civilization in case of nuclear destruction played out in earnest, as first seen through the eyes of the game developers.Having played the game on PC, and thoroughly enjoying it back in the day, this series made me feel nostalgia and intrigue in equal measure. Intrigue, because there were some subtle yet dramatic liberties, plot-twists, and character modifications. Cold-fusion energy, for instance, was new to the show.All in all, I was far from disappointed. Though I'm admittedly not a diehard fan of the franchise, I liked the games enough to appreciate what they did with this live-action adaptation - T-60 suits, Pip-Boy wrist-monitors, and all.The setting was the same as in the original, namely Los Angeles. Post-apocalyptic themes and tropes unravelled with each episode, carried on the backs of amazing performances both inside and outside the underground nuclear bunkers.An incredible amount of empathy prevailed in the tale, which fast-forwarded 200+ years into the future after LA was nuked. The plot gradually started filling out in earnest, aligning with the game's original vision in beautiful (meant artistically) ways.Kyle MacLachlan (as Overseer Hank MacLean) had an enviable screen presence. I've been a fan of his work, from ""Dune"" (1984) to ""Desperate Housewives"" (2004-2012), so seeing him give another great performance in another Sci-Fi universe was amazing.Ella Purnell (as Lucy MacLean) was the actual protagonist of this TV series. She did great work, held her own, and established a remarkable character arc. Her evolution from an innocent young vault-citizen to a confident explorer was worth watching.Moises Arias (as Norm MacLean) was both amusing and mysterious. His work in other projects are worth noting, because only then will you appreciate how nuanced his acting was in this one.Villainy with purpose... Sarita Choudhury (as Lee Moldaver) brought plenty of outstanding moments to the series. I didn't like the way things ended for her, because I was so looking forward to watching more of her in season 2 ""Fallout"". The character and the artist brought rebellious brilliance to bear on season 1, though.Aaron Moten (as Maximus) brought several notable elements to the script. His emphatic acting blended well with his more idiotic moments and lucky turns, making Maximus feel like a true survivor.Michael Emerson (as Wilzig) was amazing. I adored his work in ""Lost"" (TV series, 2004-2010). His subtle yet portentous performance was great to see in this one. The Belgian Shepherd dog he'd saved, CX404 (real name Lana 5), was a memorable addition.Michael Rapaport as Knight Titus was great, despite his brief screentime. His casual cruelty left an impression. I remember seeing Rapaport's online videos and sundry commentaries. He brought a lot of that wit and penchant for sarcasm to his limited role in season 1 of ""Fallout"".The Ghoul was my favourite character in the game and Walton Goggins didn't make me change my mind in the latest ""Fallout"" series when he expertly tackled the role of Cooper Howard. The man became one of the mutant humans called ghouls, with incredibly extended lifespans. He gave a riveting performance, blessed with swagger and suave, that made me enjoy every scene in which he showed up.""Fallout"" season 1 made me admire the game even more, especially how ahead of its time it was. I liked how they sustained a vintage-American playlist, which again was similar to the game in which we could play such songs over the radio on those wrist-bound Pip-Boys.Despite a few rushed and contrived moments, ""Fallout"" lived up to its hype and delivered some amazing, and consistently nostalgic, entertainment. All the characters were regaling. The ending of season 1 set the stage for extraordinary things to come.""Fallout"" succeeded in capturing a cinematic vibe and bottled some essential truths, particularly the one that we are all facing today, namely the consequences of war and potential nuclear fallout.--- --- ---
Noteworthy performances from Sarita Choudhury (as Lee Moldaver), Annabel O'Hagan (as Stephanie Harper), Leslie Uggams (as Betty Pearson), Cameron Cowperthwaite (as Monty), Xelia Mendes-Jones (as Dane), Jacinto Taras Riddick (as Cleric Felix), Michael Cristofer (as Elder Cleric Quintus), Mykelti Williamson (as Honcho), Joel Marsh Garland (as Biggie), Michael Abbott Jr. (as a farmer), Jon Daly (as a snake-oil salesman), Bari Hyman (as a Filly vendor), Frances Turner (as Barb Howard), Johnny Pemberton (as Thaddeus), Dave Register (as Chet), Matt Berry (as Mr. Handy / Sebastian Leslie / Snip Snip), Leer Leary (as Davey), Michael Esper (as Bud Askins / Roomba-Brain), Cherien Dabis (as Birdie), Chris Parnell (as Overseer Benjamin), Dallas Goldtooth (as Charles Whiteknife), Glenn Fleshler (as Sorrel Booker), Russell Ewing (as Sheriff Troy), Erik Estrada (as Adam), and Charlie Besso (as Tommy).",7
Can't understand the rave reviews.,"3 episodes was enough for me. Wildly over hyped show that misses almost all of its marks. The ghoul appears to be an interesting character but overall you'll be looking at your watch wondering how time seems to stand still when this show is running.Other reviewers have mentioned the naivety of the characters. It beggars belief, quite literally. Save yourself the effort of trying to like any of the characters. Maybe buy the video games?I get that they need to stretch some basic ideas out over a large number of shows but this asks for a lot of forgiveness straight up from the viewer and frankly I've run out of f's to give on this one.",3
Brilliant,"I never played the game. My only acquaintance with Fallout is watching the gameplay from aside a bit. So from this perspective I would say that this show was made brilliantly. From the plot to the character, to acting and effects. The characters are very deep and this is what mainly sold me the show. It's rare to see such writing lately.The different types of people that exist in this world were portrayed very realistically, and I specifically liked the emphasis on how difficult life circumstances don't create heroes.They also wrote Lucy's character brilliantly. They avoided of making the lately too-common mistake of writing ""strong female characters"" that are simply better than men just because they're female, similar to She-hulk and Rings of power. Lucy is strong because though all the traumas she went through practically from the beginning she never lost her friendliness, hope and never stopped to try to see the good in people. She's self-confident because she was brought up in a safe environment, not because she's a woman.The acting was also great. The main ones that I personally really liked were Ella, Walton (he's always great in all of his roles), and Dave, who someone managed to look like an innocent boy in a man's body.Anyway, highly recommend to watch this series.",9
Best TV adaptation of a game ever made,"I've been reading some of the one star reviews of this series and I felt to bad on behalf of the human race I felt the need to write my own.I loved this series. As a long time Fallout fan, I enjoyed every minute. Firstly, the attention to detail is incredible. The soundtrack, the random items on tables e.g. Sugar Bombs, the Red Rocket gas stations, the Pipboy; this was clearly created I collaboration with fans or extremely talented producers.The plot is good. They've kept the vault back stories and created their own one for the series which is great. It dovetails together nicely with the overall story arc. I like how they show the pre and post war worlds and have stitched that together through following the Ghoul.If I had a criticism, it would be that I didn't really relate to Maximus. I'm not sure if we're meant to feel sorry for him or grow to like him but it never really happened for me. I find him very cold, cowardly and uninspiring.Lucy on the other hand was great. Watching her ongoing realisation about how the world was like and seeing her get progressively tougher without losing her pure spirit was a great balancing act and Purnell nailed it for me.There was so much Fallout content in this show. But also so much missing. I'm so pleased they renewed for a second season and I'm hoping the content they've hinted at throughout series one makes an appearance. I also hope they don't rush it and keep the incredible attention to detail and pure Fallout vibe given how high they've set the bar. It'll be painful, but I'll wait if it means they make it right!",10
Fallout on Prime,"Never played the game. This show is wickedly funny. There has been atomic war and now we see the future. There are ghouls, zombies, supersized bugs. Of course humans still fighting other humans.So some live in vaults. All safe and sound. One vault is raided and the head guy is taken. The episodes revolve around his daughter,Lucy trying to find him.Of course there's more to it than that. We learn about the characters backgrounds and how they came to be. We also learn how the vaults began and how they are maintained.The vaults see to be paradise but lets just say not all is well in ""paradise""
Hope to see more
(NOT FOR KIDS EARNS M rating)",9
Very good work,"Incredible adaptation, I'm a Huge fan of the game since the very beginning and following the story ever since, excellent work and I'm looking forward for the second season, 20 thumbs up!!Going right now to start over the video game franchise, so many emotional moments just like in the game, so many action sequences just like the game and so many landmarks very well used,I missed some iconic animals, characters and of course the first sight of a mutant, underworld, some amazing cities like rivet city, look at the enclave and many awesome details.Excellent series, excellent actors and production.",10
Excellent to watch.,"Ok so never played the game, but the trailer caught our eye, can't stop watching it. Visually stunning and entertaining plot line. The sets and characters are entirely believable, plus the way in which its written brings you in from the start. Each character has been given ample time to understand the background to them and as the series is progressing you begin to understand whats motivation for each one of them.Ive also got to give a mention to the music that has been selected for it, absolutely brilliant, if you didn't like off thevwall 50s and obscure country you will by the time you start watching.Sit down grab a bottle of wine, relax and enjoy.",10
A good series with some flaws,"Fallout is an adaptation of the eponymous gaming series which I am a fan of. It is overall a decent series but with some caveats. If you are not familiar with the setting you will feel lost, I saw it with my girlfriend and she had some issues following everything. Because, things aren't explained very well, it almost feels as if they expect the viewers to be familiar with the setting.The series biggest issue is the pacing, some of the middle episodes drag on a bit and it feels like barely anything happened. The ending is excellent with twists that somewhat redeems the rest of the series. Barely anything is revealed along the middle episodes and they have instead crammed everything on the final episode. I feel it would have been better if they had sprinkled some of these reveals and surprises in between the other episodes.I definitely recommend the series, but don't go in expecting an amazing one, you will definitely have a good time though. Expect to also be a bit confused during the series and expect to feel lost until the ending which will explain everything. A good series that could have been excellent 7/10.",7
Perfect on details as the game,"I started to watch the serie and the first episode reproduce the vault exactly the game is. It is a big revival for the people who play fallout 1 2 3 4 and 76 for manny years. I enjoyed every minute of this season. Great jog Amazon Prime.The characters are similar to the game, Brotherhood of Steels, Maximus, the supervisor of the Vault 33, the clothes, the big armor.On the beggining you can see a commercial on the tv before the nuclear bomb starts the destruction, it is possible to see the Nuka Cola and the magazine of Agnarok.The vault is full of details, the advertisement on the walls, the guns and everythingBrillant serie of the year.",10
Gave it a 7. But if this is canon its a 3,"I have a sneaking suspision that Tod Howard had too much influence on this.And it seems they threw New Vegas under the bus..
One of the best fallout games ever..
If this is true it's really sad, and seemingly spiteful..
I enjoyed the show for the most part, was alot of strong preformances.But the first half of the show was far better than the second half.It seems like it had alot of direction and drive first few episodes and then just lost itself by the end..
All in all it's not a bad show and had some cool acting, humor and gore..
But was bogged down by wierd pacing later episodes and alot of tropes..
And some boring/small sets and very small finale fight..",7
When the vault door is openned ... disappointment is found.,"I am not a fan of the fallout games, as I have never played them. However, I assume there's plenty of good material, enough to make a good show. Perhaps my expectations were high, but I was not impressed by the story. Sure, some acting was good and the scenery was done well, but the story wasn't good. There is a source of infinite energy that's planted inside Ben Linus's head. There is an ironman suit that apparently anyone can use without much training. There are super zombies called ghouls, that can stay alive for a very long time, and still have all their mental faculties. Some guy living in the middle of nowhere can survive without food or water. Fingers can be attached and function perfectly. And the cherry on the top, in the final episode of season 1. Vault-Tek decided to nuke the planet because of capitalism. Sad times we live in.",5
Amazing,"It's one of the best series ever reminds me of the games franchise, and also had many game quest references like the boy in a fridge, also the brotherhood of steel feels is exactly like in the game, awesome work, which brings a more of a nostalgia and feel of the game and bethesda did a great job in mixing those with the series, i didn't see any conflict in the series plot and the game's franchise which is great, i can't wait for season 2 i hope it doesn't take long as i almost losing my patience because it got many mysteries to be solved viewers might have many questions in mind regarding those, i hope to see the institute and synths in the second season.",10
Wow! Flashbacks of playing the game!!,"This show is pretty spot on! A bit better than another Video game show I have been watching!! I keep seeing places that I saw in the game, places I went into and explored. Makes me want to play the games again! The bloodiness, violence and cornyness is exactly how the game was! I am having so many aha moments, elbowing my husband, saying, ""Hey that scene or monster or character looks just like the game!! The characters are pretty close to what was in the game! Loving it so far!!PKeep following the games and we will continue to watch the show.If you haven't played the games, I hope this inspires you, they are so much fun and you have to use your imagination to make them your own!!",8
It's Fun!,"It's easy to be a pessimist in film and tv now in days. I'm not different. I had zero hope in this series, but it truly does deliver. I am already watching it again. Where there are some questions of lore accuracy and the somewhat shoe horned romance doesn't feel necessary, it is just fun. I had fun watching it and truly love the use of practical effects when done. I do hope they keep steering in that direction, but just watch. I had a good time both times!It keeps the whimsy of the wasteland while having the grim aspects. I do wish the world was a little bigger? I think of the towns in fallout games vs the show, it does feel rather baron.",9
"Not perfect, but I really enjoyed it.","Greetings from the other side. I don't think I played this game back in 1997, as I was enjoying Ultima Online at that time. Therefore, I came into this without any preconceptions.I really enjoyed this first season, especially Coggins as the ghoul. There were some things that I didn't care for, like all of the old 50s music. It would have been better if they played less of that.The effects were good. The T-60 battle Armour was fun to watch in action. I'd love to try out something like that, as I'm sure we all would. The ghoul character was probably my favorite in this show. He was just so entertaining whenever he was on screen. Ella and Max were well done characters as well.I also enjoyed the various crazy characters that they bumped into during their journey.I'm looking forward to a second season, and totally recommend this series.",8
I WANT MORE!!!,"As a fan of the game series and a fan of film and stories, this is one of the greatest things I have ever seen. It's just as fantastic as the game. It's twisted, enthralling and pure insanity. The humor plays perfectly. The tech plays out perfectly. I won't even call this fan service as that term feels cheap. This is something special. This show brought us here from the game and I think this show will bring others to the game. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire 8 episodes. It's a wasteland opera that exceeded my wildest expectations. I absolutely love Lucy as the protagonist. What a fantastic choice and direction to take and Ella nailed it. Goggins was absolutely fantastic. I can't wait to see the path of Maximus continue and was very well played by Aaron. Absolutely loved him. I was unsure of what to make of Norm right up until the end but it turns out he's just one more character I can't wait to see more of. Well done Mr. Airas, well done. I'm giving this. 10/10 because I loved every minute. I can't wait to make my father watch this and get hooked. He has no idea of what he has in his future and I'm sure that old man is going to love it.",10
Perfect!!!,The whole series is inspired by an very old popular classic game called fall out and being a fall out player getting a series based on it made me feel happy and now I came to know that the whole series is absolutely very cool. Performance of all the characters fits well. So this is a must watch series like Wednesday addams and other few good series. Definitely worth 10/10 rating from my side and I hope that season 2 will be arrived soon with a lot of good content like the season 1 did and I hope that it will be great and cool. If you still didn't watched the series then go and watch it out immediately!!!,10
Errrrrrm,"Once again I wrote a review without watching the whole season and once again IMDb deleted that review, just like they did for 3 Body Problem.Well I have now watched the full season of Fallout because for some reason I couldn't turn it off, I kept thinking this is terrible and I should watch something else, but I just couldn't.I certainly didn't enjoy the comedy, but I did enjoy the performance of some of the actors, like Walton Goggins and Aaron Moten, but my special praise is for Ella Purnell who I thought was brilliant, so the 7 I've given it is just for Ella, I think without her I wouldn't have watched the whole series.I don't know much about the games as I've only played one of the once, and I got bored, so is this meant to have comedy?",7
Excellent world building and plot twist will keep you glued to this series,"I ended up binge watching the entire series in one night - that is just how engrossing this streaming series is.It's a voyage of discovery in a post-nuclear apocalypse world as a young woman exits from her underground vault in search of her father, who has been carried off by raiders who entered from the surface Wasteland.There are some plot twists involving Evil Capitalists and flashbacks about how and why the entire Vault Tech network of underground nuclear shelters was set up in the first place.The flashbacks are set in a sort of 1960s era fashion style which is also interesting.All in all, this was a great show, and I'm looking forward to watching the second season already.P. S. I'm not a gamer so I don't know much about the lore of the video game series this is based on, but having seen a lot of other movies and TV series based on video games, most of them don't come anywhere close to this level of quality, so this is a major plus.",9
Bad script but great acting,"Let's start with the positives. The characters and the acting are great, a real tribute to the Fallout series. I enjoyed the sets and the quirky but amusing dialogue. I see a lot of criticism of the cheap sets and inconsistencies but they are nitpicking. Personally I didn't notice anything that disturbed my sense of disbelief. From a visual aspect I really enjoyed it.The negative is the cowardice of the script writers. I won't put any spoilers in but I can say that if you see anything bad happen then don't worry they will invent a stupid plot device to make it unhappen. Once you realise they keep doing this then you get uninvested in the characters as you know nothing will really happen to them. There are no real consequences for any actions they take.If you accept this series has less gravitas than a Tom and Jerry cartoon and are ok with watching it for the one liners then it's a fun way to waste a few hours. On the other hand if you like caring about characters and how they develop then move on.",7
Worried about people's taste,"I don't understand how this show is so well rated. The actors where well cast but everything else seems slighlty off. Especially the tone. I always thought it was ironic humor within a devastatingly bleak atmosphere. The colors are off too, it needs a filter (half joke). Everything seems to easy. Big disappointment. I think it's over for me as a Fallout fan because F4 had the same problem. It was a fun game but it didn't have a lot of depth. Sound familiar? This is my gripe with the show illustrated by: Wilzig has been walking around for days by Episode 2 and his shirts are still ironed? It feels like no one is actually thinking what it would be like to be in the Wasteland. If you are like me and you didn't like the show, it might be time to say goodbye because this is the direction that fallout will be taking. Constant Marvel style jokes but about sex. Non stop. Oof. But Im not the first to complain. When Fallout was underground it could be truly subversive, critical and new. When it becomes mainstream it becomes just that, status quo rebelliousness.",5
"Great show, with 1 minor issue.","I have played all the games and was eagerly anticipating the release of the show. To be honest, I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. I was expecting a lighthearted approach with more comedy and less violence and gore. However, I was pleasantly shocked by the direction the show took, which was a perfect blend of action, violence, humor, and storytelling.The pacing of each episode was spot on, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout. I was hooked from the very first episode, and each subsequent episode left me wanting more. The story was captivating, and I loved how the show explored it from every perspective. I found myself empathizing with each faction, and I couldn't help but feel invested in their respective journeys. At the moment, I am firmly on team Coop, but I am open to switching sides in the upcoming season.However, the only minor issue I had with the show was something that most people could probably guess. I understand that many studios feel compelled to include certain elements for political reasons, and this show was no exception. While I acknowledge the importance of these issues, I felt that it detracted somewhat from the overall experience. Despite this, I still greatly enjoyed the show and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling, action-packed adventure with plenty of heart and soul.",9
Nailed it,"I'm more of a casual Fallout game fan, so the franchise isn't precious to me. I'm more of a Elder Scrolls fan. As such, I adore this show! It blends the perfect ratio of silliness, comedy, drama, intrigue, and action. The casting is spot on, with Ella Purnell stealing the show. It's nicely shot, the music is great....there are no flaws here. I really hope they can keep the quality up for multiple seasons.I'm increasingly getting fed up with Amazon streaming and their business model, ads, etc, but they keep making great shows. I wish they didn't so I could cancel my membership and feel good about myself...but here we are, dammit. Well done again, Amazon.",9
Unexpectedly Wonderful,"As a long-time fan of the games, I honestly cringed when I saw they'd made an adaptation, but boy was I wrong. This show is amazing! The casting is incredible and there's something for the gamer and first-time watcher. Okay, I lied. There's a lot more for the gamer: Countless nods to beloved characters, incredible graphics and set design, great casting, writing, cinematography and music alike. I eagerly await many seasons to come and am so glad I gave it a chance, only to devour the the entire season in a scant few days. Keep up the great work, Mr. Nolan and company. You've renewed my love of this fantastic franchise and made me hopeful for a new game to follow.",10
Excellent production and cast,"The show is filled with many aspects of fallout,with a amazing to say at least story line behind each characters. There is a character for everyone's personality to enjoy and enhance the experience of watching the 8 episode season, which is surly going to have a second season coming to production. Each episode having a somewhat intoxicating addiction to binge watch the entire season in one sitting. Proves to be a fully successful and encaptive show. Allowing each episode to recape its last, and be just as enjoyable as the last if not better. I have never written a review for anything but u would truly appreciate a second season.",10
Outstanding Suprise!,"(8.7)As a long-time fan of the video game franchise and a cinematographer myself, this series checks all the boxes. If you are a fan, there's no way you will not like this! And even if you never heard of Fallout, you will definitely get hooked.While it is not the most amazing or original of stories, the plot is at the very least good. But this is one of those cases where it is not about the general plot but the details and well-written journey. It's a wild adventure full of moral questioning that is, in most cases, overshadowed by the well-achieved humor or the gore and violent scenes, which is just what Fallout is all about.I was especially surprised by how well they captured the ambiance and vibe of the Fallout apocalyptic world, the art design, the OST, the costume design, and especially the VFX (although the last episode did fall a little in this department) were all at a blockbuster level of detail and realism.I cannot wait for the next season!",9
A joy to watch.,"To be able to watch a show that completely captures a game that I spent hundreds of hours delving in the world of fallout is really special. The characters are true to fallout form and the world building was percise. The atmosphere was able to take you one step beyond what the game could to really bring the fallout world to life in a way the game could not, because you are generally too busy looting and min maxing to really read every report on a vault computer. Overall it is something truly special. I hope the next season sticks to this formula and can't wait for the next single player fallout.",10
Fallout Review,"A thrilling journey through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, capturing the essence of the beloved game franchise. With its gritty atmosphere, complex characters, and nods to the game lore, it's a treat for both fans and newcomers alike. The cast delivers stellar performances, especially in portraying the struggle for survival and moral ambiguity in a world ravaged by nuclear war. While some pacing issues arise, the captivating story and immersive world-building more than compensate. Overall, the Fallout TV show is a must-watch for anyone craving dystopian adventures and thought-provoking narratives.",7
Breath of fresh air!,"From the trailers I was like man...idk if I'm gonna like this. Especially with how video game adaptations have gone in the past. But this show IMHO overall is an 8. Some episodes are a 6/10 but I think when you add up all of the storylines and the lore. It's fantastic and an absolute blast. You really start to relate to all of the main leads and see their character development throughout. Especially found myself interested in Norm and the vault storyline. It became super creepy and tense and my only wish is that that had more of a payoff.This is coming from someone who started with New Vegas, then fallout 3 and Fallout 4. This show was awesome.",8
"Season 1 entertaining, but needs better writers - and acting is very hit or miss","Season 1 of Fallout is entertaining, but having too many writers and directors involved definitely made things often feel a bit too awkward and convoluted, and The Last of Us still blows this away by a *very* wide margin in terms of storytelling, character development, and performances...because unlike TLOU I imagine it's pretty tough for most non-video game players to be able to find lots to love here in terms of the messy plotlines and character development...and I hate to say it, but *all* the castmembers portraying members of the ""Brotherhood"" could use some serious acting lessons, and also could benefit from better dialogue from more seasoned TV screenwriters too...like its genuinely uncomfortable to watch most of the Brotherhood scenes throughout the entire season 😔On the other hand, Walton Goggins (and we need more Matt Berry and Dogmeat!!!) is the clear MVP among the cast, and Ella Purnell also does solid work as Lucy too (but again, she's needs much better screenwriters to back her up because she's clearly an experienced actress that already has the range!), but I was actually surprised how great Moises Arias turned out to be as Lucy's younger brother and his character had the most interesting plot line of the whole season imo.My least favorite part is that I *really* wish the writing wasn't so corny for Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten...Some pretty painful cringeworthy moments when the writers tried to muddle humor and romance in ways that winds up just feeling like a bad marvel movie. And there was so embarrassingly little chemistry there to begin with, so it felt so out of place and unnecessary that these two characters were even forced to be in a relationship to begin with.On a more positive note, what impressed me most of all was the attention to detail in the practical elements of the production design - you can tell the set designers are massive fans of the games! 😊Overall, lots of fun twists in the last episode (Kyle Machlachlan doesn't disappoint 👑), but in general, I think this first season is definitely way too overhyped - still a fun watch for a rainy weekend or something though!",7
"A very predictable ""waste"" of time.","The only thing that drew me to this show other than playing the Fallout games was Walton Goggins and Kyle MacLachlan. The trailer for this series looked very promising but ended up being deceiving. The story alone is very predictable with no effort to put certain twist on events along with jaw dropping cliffhangers, just flat out boring. I know that Lucy is naive vault-dweller I don't need to be reminded all 8 episodes. I know that Maximus is a scared man seeking acceptance from the Brotherhood of steel, move it along!!! The Ghouls story was the most impressive story throughout the series other than that it was just ehhh.. CGI was absolutely disgusting and disrespectful to the art of film, stop using that trash when you have talented makeup artist that need work. Please forgive me for this but don't make a season 2.",1
Masterpiece adaption of an incredible game,"I just had to write a review about Fallout in case people were on the fence on whether to watch it or not. This is an absolute masterpiece, from the storytelling to the cinematography, beautifully crafted and made me really engaged in this world that was created. Being a game adaption I honestly had my doubts because I have always seen Halo and no thanks that series disappointed so much.This is a must watch series, I couldn't fault it. I watched the entire season 1 in one sitting, started watching at approximately 6pm and finished into the early hours of the next morning, it was that good I couldn't stop.",10
Okey Dokey,"I ended up binge watching the whole series within 24 hours. I would say after the first episode, I wasn't convinced that I would watch the whole series. But actually it grew on me.I'm a big fan of the Fallout game franchise, although I haven't played it in a while. I would recognise that it's not easy converting a video game story into a tv series or a movie without disappointing fans: a bit like the Assassins Creed Movie.This one actually worked. The action in the series, the way injuries and kills happen in the series, wouldn't work in a typical film or movie as it's unrealistic, only works in video games. But they kept the video game effect in the series. So it gets away with it. But that's probably because I'm a Fallout fan. I won't recommend it to any non-fallout fans as they simply won't get it.I don't usually watch tv series', as I can't get into them anymore: they require time and focus. Most series' don't catch my full attention. But this one did.I hope we won't have to wait too long for a second season.",8
Fanboys can go to vault 112 and be happy there :)),"Fallout was one of my first games ever and played every single one of them, i'm huge fanboy too and i can't believe those fanatics giving low ratings lol. I was expecting something worse to be honest but other than some minor setbacks that can surely be ignored, even newcomers can really enjoy this fun show. Yes for the newcomers this universe has a lot to take in and in the first glance it can be really really overwhelming and the show does not make a good job to ease you in, it does it later on but they should have just start with 'war, war never changes' and explain the state of the world for the viewers to digest it in. After a few episodes it really explains a lot expecially about the vault tec and the political, social, ethical spects about the universe but for an 8 episode series they should have done the explaining in 15 minutes and jump into the action. It's so goofy and cheesy and it doesnt take itself seriously like the games, acting is great even though i was prepared to hate Lucy but i didn't lol. Goggins is delight to watch as always, Maximus is an amazing character with a plenty of room to grow. Music is unbelievable, designs are Oscar worthy, great production really captures the life in the vaults but it comes a little bit short when it comes to westlands but it will become better in S2 i hope. Screw the fanatic fanboys really just enjoy this beauty..",9
It's your classic not quite right but good enough.,"So first off been a Fallout fan actually since Wasteland.I went into this show with low expectations based on the plummet the games have seen recently.I noticed it only had one major actor I know Walton Goggins.Without spoiling much the first Ep was awkward.However once things got going like in the real games, it was dark and dirty outside.I enjoyed a good many nods to various games though out of base context.I liked the usage of Pipboy which was a staple in games.The FX are weird some are good some seem a bit cheap but ok for a show.The thing that makes this show a 9 to me is even though they screw up a lot, they make up with fun characters and good recoveries.So many videogame or any other media based shows are just filler with little else.I am looking forward to the next season.",9
I'm impressed...,"As someone who lived through the period in which the film industry tended to transform the beloved game series like Resident Evil, Doom, and others into films and television programs and how bad and horrific were those works that were made without soul and without passion and did not contain the spirit of the games from which they were made, except for the series The Last of Us. So I wasn't excited about this series and I didn't even want to watch it, but I said let's give it a chance and I was really impressed. Starting from the surprising title of the first episode and the very wonderful story that never leaves you bored of it due to the unexpected events and the exciting progression of the story, this story can be described as completely non-vulgar. It is an ideal story with a smooth progression of events, in addition to the good transition between stories, as well as the transition between the past and the present, which does not leave you with any kind of disorientation and distraction. As for the characters, the acting was very convincing. In fact, I loved all the characters, and I loved how the story gave depth to each character. I also liked the seriousness and bloodiness of the series, and how this stagnation and seriousness was broken with some wonderful black comedy that did not spoil the seriousness of the shot. I was also impressed by the quality of photography and the background music that suits every scene. I also liked the nature of the conflict between capitalism and communism in the series and how it Companies' greed can literally drive them crazy. This series is an example of a series that did not rely only on the name of the game in order to succeed, but rather relied on creating a beautiful story with wonderful acting and a clear identity for the game. I am very excited for the second season and I cannot wait to watch it.",9
Best series in years,"I really enjoyed fallout. The acting is great, the story unfolds gradually right up until the last episode. Lucy is a great character she retains her goodness even though she gradually does worse and worse things.Maximus is a great Baddy/goody.His character is not that likeable, but he kind of becomes a better person through the season. The ghoul is a great baddie and his cowboy vibe is a great addition to the show.I wasn't able to predict much of the story. There were surprise twists but it was still believable (in a post apocalyptic scenario).With three storylines unfolding at the same time it keeps you engaged.I really hope there are lots more seasons.",10
Not the worst but not as good as they say,"I wanted to love this show, i really did. The trailer looked awesome, however I was left disappointed and a little bit frustrated. My rating would be a 6.7 if the site would let me do partial stars. I think the raving reviews come from people who have played the game and watched the show through rose tinted glasses. I can see how watching it through the lense of nostalgia may make it seem better than it is, because in reality it's a ""just ok"" show.** spoilers below **They spent so much time on the exposition and yet don't show a lot of important things. The climax is condensed into the last episode and the resolution is what... like a 5 minutes?The last episode didn't have a huge impact. There were some interesting twists and revelations but still, it lacked the wow factor because I didn't really care about the characters.I realised after episode one that I didn't like it that much but I kept watching in hopes of the show improving. By ep. 3 I still didn't care about any of the characters, none of them seemed likable to me. In the last episode Lucy has this big emotional scene and it wasn't that moving for me, and I'm that person who cries at movies even in the cinema. That revelation and science had sooo much potential if the show had built the character better, had made Lucy more rounded and made the viewer really care about her.Lucy and Maximus have no chemistry. They show so little of them together and don't spend enough time showing their relationship. The kiss scene felt so awkward and forced because of the lack of feeling. The vibes I got from them is comradery and friendship *at most*.Maximus is a weird character. He's full of contradictions and i just don't like him. He has some redeeming qualities but he kind of just stumbles into situations without doing much. He's too passive, I don't understand his motivation, he's just weird.The ghoul was at least interesting, inwas curious about his story because the show spends a lot of time showing his past. What happened tonhim, how did he end up like this? I was very much looking forward to finding those out but the show doesn't explain it (yet? Maybe in S2)Lucy is... OK. I feel like the actor did her best with the material she was given. It's just that they didn't give the character enough dimension. I understand she is supposed to be naive, but that can't be her whole personality.Norm is sooo unlikeable. I also don't understand how old he's supposed to be? He looks 16 and 64 at the same time and it's unsettling. His character is the worst. At least he grows a couple of vertebrae towards the end, not a full backbone, but maybe C1 to C7.I liked the dog the most.I had high hopes for the show, and maybe too high expectations. I expected ""The last of us"" quality and it did not meet that expectation. I went into it without having played the game or knowing the lore, just like with ""The last of us"" and i think that show is one of the best, a 9 for me.But, as one other reviewers said, it's OK to like the show even if it's not perfect, and at the end of the day it's just a show. I don't think it deserves the 8.7 rating but hey, maybe for someone this is the best show they've ever seen and had an amazing time watching it and that's fine. It's not the worst, bit not that good. I just expected better.",6
Brilliant adaptation for dystopian post-apocalyptic fans!,"Within the first episode you can tell the quality of the production is excellent. Incredible sets and props combine with a well written story line, supported by a very talented cast, for a visual feast that does not fail to entertain. Ella Purnell is perfectly cast as 'Lucy' and brings a solid performance to the role. Walter Goggins is a gifted actor and fulfills the role of 'The Ghoul' with his own personal flair. The supporting cast has a wide scope of talent with a long list of quality credits to their names.Overall, I found this to be a show that is well written, well produced, and well cast. It stands in a class with series like ""See"", ""Silo"", ""Into the Badlands"" and ""The Last of Us"".Even if this genre isn't typically on your list, I highly recommend giving 'Fallout' a view. The story presentation itself warrants a watch and the visuals are (sorry for the cliché) a true feast for the eyes.👍 👍",9
Not Bad,"I don't know the games and I don't know if that's an advantage or a disadvantage (for judging the show) - anyway, the show offers solid entertainment with some funny moments, the production is top-notch for a TV show, and the cast is solid too. What annoys me the most is the soundtrack - not necessarily the music itself, but in my opinion, too many scenes are unnecessarily underscored with music that often doesn't fit what's being shown, and it sometimes really gets on my nerves - less is more so to say. Other than that, if you don't expect too much, you'll get well-produced trash without great aspirations: popcorn cinema for the right kind of audience - I enjoyed the ride but for sure Fallout is not a masterpiece like so many reviewers claim but way better than Halo or The Last of Us.",7
The Show Was Rigged From the Start,"The cast: unattractive men, a strong independent woman who deals with raiders at level 0, and a couple of veterans like Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Emerson.There is no chemistry between the characters. Everyone who could've carried this piece of art appears for 5 minutes at most. A vault dweller sees the ocean for the first time and shows zero emotions with the phrase ""Okey-Dokey."" Stanislavski gives a standing ovation.Absolutely everyone wears clean clothes in any situation. The locations and props are either restored from the video games without imagination, or are similar to modern times, except that they painted burning debris here and there.10% clowning, 60% fan service and 30% fixation on sex. The series leaves you with the feeling that the script was written by a teenager with sperm toxicity who overplayed Fallout 3.",2
Nearly perfect on the mark,"This show is incredible. It hits everything you could possibly want from a show about Fallout. You have wacky weapons, great lines, fun characters, and absolutely insane revelations. This show gave me absolutely everything I wanted from it and I couldn't have possibly asked for more. I have an issue with most new shows where they have to have an insufferable character who plays no role other than beying as annoying as humanly possible. This show subverted my expectations and made every character interesting and enjoyable to see on screen. My only issue is that we didn't get answers on how Moldaver has survived the last 200 years or so. She's not a ghoul or a synth given her death (if she truly died) at the end of the season. I would have given this show a 10 if they hadn't needlessly left this unanswered.I think they've masterfully brought this world into a tv series and I don't think I've ever been more excited for a season 2. I genuinely hope they bring this show back.",9
Surgically perfect,"I just finished watching episode 8 and this was one of those series that left me feeling a bit sad that there is no more to see as of now.I have to say I am partially biased since I've played every game from Fallout 3 to now, replayed them and doing some lore reading.Before I saw the first episode I was a bit worried that this could be a show that was just ""made for the fans"" with little passion to the whole world and stories of Fallout. But after I started watching I realized that the Director, studio and everyone involved have given this production their whole hearts and minds to make this a perfect series to not just get approval by the Fallout fans but to also breed a new generation of Fallout maniacs. I will not be surprised if this show bumps up Fallout game sales a lot.I am happy they wrote a completely new story for this show, and they left a bit of bones tho chew on for us that loved the games.I don't wanna dig in too much about the story and the characters because I want everybody I know to watch this. So please, see this if you want a different, extremely well produced show with great acting talent.Nolan and Joy do not mess around or live on hope. They make it surgically perfect to the last detail.",10
What Video Game Adaptations Should Be,"One of the biggest mistakes you can make when adapting a film is to reject the original media and instead make your own unrelated story with a completely different feel inside the universe. What fallout did was exactly the opposite.What I love most about this TV show is that it effectively balances between the dark comedy and serious events that the original games had. There's also some fun subtle nods to a whole range of things that have been moved into the show from the game, whether that be the weapons or even the armour shop in the second episode.Of course the show wouldn't be complete without the music, and what I really enjoyed about Ramin Djawadi's music was that it encapsulated the soundtrack of the original fallout games. As considering a lot of music score for film now is more ""zimmery"" ambience and sound design based, it's refreshing to hear some more orchestral works.",9
Okey Dokey,"What a great adaptation to the Fallout games, I was hoping the series would be good and it is. Great characters and great cinematography.I dont know what upset the Fallout fanbase, im one of them and cant see anything wrong with what i just saw. All weapons are there, suits, the vaults everything is fallout. The only thing missing is deathclaws and that will definitely come in the next seasons.Great to see that they didnt follow a story from the game but created a new story, a new story that can lead to many directions covered by many series and im looking forward to what will follow.""War never changes.""",9
Best entertainment I've seen in a long while!,"This has to be the best series I've ever seen based on a game!Truly gripping, gore and bloodshed with a plot that always had me guessing!Totally unpredictable!Loved it and certainly looking forward to season 2.Honestly can't say a bad word about this series, the sets wasn't CGI and you can see a lot of time and effort has gone into making this.I don't know what else to say, just this is making me write 600 words and I have said everything I needed to.That being said, just watch it and I can assure you, you will not be disappointed!Enjoy, be ready to binge the whole series haha bye.",10
Outstanding Odyssey of Human Horror,"Another GREAT video game-to-series adaptation that proves why the vast landscape of games cannot be adequately captured in a 2 hour movie.Its accomplishments:
it requires absolutely no prior knowledge about the games to enjoy the story.creates a brand new post apocalyptic world for TV that implements the unique retro-future aesthetic of the game with great success.compelling characters with complex moral compasses that perfectly suit the worldjust the right amount of unexpected, well implemented comedic moments that are handled masterfully.has that westworld-like mysterious conspiracy floating in the air thing that I personally couldn't get enough of!Considering I've only finished fallout 4 and played about 70% of fallout 3, I personally felt that.... THE SERIES IS BETTER THAN THE GAME(s) 🙈Will play new vegas next and then my opinion might change, let's see.",10
"Good, but not amazing","So, yeah. 2 episodes in, I felt like I needed a break. I'll probably finish the season in the very near future, but I can't binge this. The Fallout world building is just not my cup of tea. Silly alternative universe with rediculous 1950s tech, space marines, mutants and a happy-go-lucky (attempt at) funny approach to grotesque. The approach to the human mind and psyche is skin deep at best.Disclaimer, while I'm a gamer I haven't played the Fallout games. Although I know the theme and what they're mostly about. So nothing in the show was really surprising or new. It's probably a good show, especially in light of the original material... (?). Fans of the games will definitely love it. Probably rightly so as well, cause while it's not for me, even I can tell this is well done. I'm not sure it's going to have a much broader appeal and staying power in the general populace though.For me what's annoying at this point is all the hype, especially from journalists who keep talking about this show along with The Last Of Us. A show that has been lauded by gamers and non-gamers alike. This show (Fallout) is nowhere near the masterful artwork that tLoU TV series is. It's a joke and a glaring issue with the rating system that they have the same rating (although one with 516k ratings and one with 21k). These shows should not be compared because no matter what, tLoU will come out on top in every possible comparison related to story and quality. I'm sure some will object and disagree (vehemently), but come on - be real. Take a step back and assess from an objective distance.I'm not trying to make enemies or piss people off here, hehe (sorry, I know fanboy are protective). Just want to let others, especially non-gamers, know that if they've seen glowing reviews and come expecting another tLoU, they might be a bit disappointed. So curb your expectations a bit. Maybe think The Boys more than The Last of Us. You might just really enjoy yourself if you don't take it too seriously.",
Great show! Only 8 episodes???,"This was an amazing show! Everything was beautifully written, the characters were intriguing. The plot was captivating. But only 8 episodes? Why? There was enough to make this a full season. Now, how long do I have to wait for season 2? 3 years for just another 8 episodes? Idk...seems like a lot of build up just to be disappointed by such a long wait for half a season.Now the obligatory gibberish to make the character requirement
Lalalalalalalalalalalallalalalalamalamamamamlalalalalamalamamlalalalalalalalalalalalallalalalalalalalalalalslsmsmeijskskakakakkalalalalalalalalalalalalalalaaamamamsm.",6
We need more like this.,"This was a passion to make for a lot of people and you can tell. I was completely engrossed the entire time and loved the attention to detail. Fans of the game series will pick up all the Easter eggs and call backs, new people to the lore should enjoy the world building and fascinating characters. Meanwhile, the story archs and characters are firmly rooted in legitimate takes on human nature. Each characters is worth examining and discussing at length and the performances by the actors really brought the wasteland to life. I think one of the big factors in making a good story in the days of AI writing and overly fast productions is maintaining the authenticity and real human emotions that people pour into the source material. Fallout was able to maintain that orginal link from the first (and later) game writers to the show, at least in their intent to convey the story authentically. A problem when translating one media to another like game to show or book to movie is that the imagery and content are portrayed but message or underlying philosophy gets missed. I felt like fallout was successful in making a point. We need more media that can articulate a point.",10
"Ok-ish, but could be better...","I'm an old school Fallout fan, meaning I appreciate more the Black Isle Studios era of the game. I watched the series, but it felt a bit like it was written by AI. Many member-berries to please gaming community, showcasing game mechanics which is out of place in the TV show (bullet time, stimpacks etc.) Scenario is very gamey, which is to be expected on one hand, but lackluster on the other as this is not the same media or experience.Characters (Maximus strikes me as ""Finn"" ) and writing are quite superficial, enough for a game, but could be better for a drama/series. Humor is supposed to be dark and witty ( think Monty Python Easter eggs, Harold, Sulik, terminal logs...) and to me it comes out short - to banal and too shallow.Too many irrelevant, boring and repeated scenes, too little character building/drama (exception being Cooper Howard ...) Scenario is also a bit awkward as it is placed too far into the future to be plausible (160 or so years after Fallout 1, and within same geographic region). Whatever happened to the water chip?",7
"Average, but a huge missed opportunity","Fallout could have been great. Could have been epic, but I can't help feeling they missed the boat. I think they made two huge mistakes in this series.First - they failed to introduce the world. As a fallout superfan I get it all but others won't. They will see silliness and zaniness without explanation and it will turn people off.They should have had the entire first season take place within the vault as a primer. Through that lens we could have learned about the vaults, the war and the surface. Raiders, ghouls, bottlecaps as currency, why the music is all 50s and all the retro things about fallout despite the advanced tech (laserguns drugs and food that doesn't spoil, why a stimpack heals her stab wound, etc). We could have learned about the world in an academic antiseptic way while having some tension within the vault as the season 1 story culminating with the opening of the vault door as the finale. That would make the jarring change between seasons real for the viewer just like it is for the protagonist as we see the differences between the book learning of the vault and the real world..Barring that at least 2-3 episodes in the vault doing the same. Everything feels so rushed in this telling.Second - they needed to tone DOWN the silliness of the games and take it slightly more seriously. Yes it can be a bit campy and such but slightly more muted than the games. Seems they went the other way instead.The writing is ok, the acting is ok, and so far the series is... well.. ok. Not great, not terrible. It could have been great.",5
Fans made this show,"You can tell that a lot of love was put in the show. If you are a fan of the game you will not stop smiling at every scene. Whoever did this, they knew the word that they would be working. From the vistas, the colors, the music, the costumes. Everything is screaming fallout. It keeps raising the tone until the last episode when the teases become the real thing (I won't spoil)Basically as someone who played all games, and not only playing. But reading the lore spread in the game. As a kid I would think for myself how they didn't make a show about this already. They have everything written already, just pick a spot, a vault and some main quest and you are set...Guess what ? It's what they did.I'm genuinely happy with this show and it's plot.If you are crying about some of the old factions being dead. I have news for you. War...war never changes...",10
An incredibly solid show that's worth watching for both fans and newcomers,"What's great about Fallout is that you can go completely blind into it, not having played the video games, and you'll still understand everything and be immersed in the world and story being told. For those who've played the games, it's real treat seeing the world and all the lore-related things come to life on the tv screen. The set designs are impressive, the CGI is solid and the attention to detail is on point. This is a show that does justice to the games while also telling it's own unique story. If you've played the games, you can tell they did their research and really tried to emulate the style and feel of the world. The aesthetic, the look, the feel, the tone - they nailed it all. It felt very surreal to watch a video game world come to life in live action so seamlessly. The cinematography and lighting is top notch and definitely elevates the whole experience. The music, done by the same guy who did the music for Game of Thrones (Ramin Djawadi), did a great job with the score.Walton Goggins is iconic and amazing as The Ghoul. His character's arc was really interesting to watch. Ella Purnell did a fantastic job playing Lucy. Lucy is the definition of how you write a strong female character. Woke Hollywood can learn a few things from this show. Her charm, her humor and those big pretty eyes really sell it. Lucy's character development was one of the best. Seeing her go through her tough journey, growing as a person and character, while also discovering the truth, was insanely satisfying to watch. It's not only how you write an interesting and compelling female character lead, but it's also how you write any great character arc. Everyone's a beautifully flawed character and it works especially in the world of Fallout. We get to see how far someone is willing to go in order to get what they want.The storytelling is probably one of the most compelling and amazing things about the show. It reminded me a lot of the way Pulp Fiction is told. The way it jumps around to different characters' stories and the way it goes back and forth from the present to the past and back again. Really great storytelling going here. The acting is top notch, never once did it feel corny, lame or phony. The one thing that can be a bit over the top at times is the blood and violence. It can be quite brutal. But you gotta remember, this show is based on a game where getting a perfectly placed headshot on an enemy makes their head explode into a million fleshy pieces. And you also gotta remember the post apocalyptic messed up world in which it takes place in. A lot of times they use these super violent moments as a way of injecting a bit of dark humor - and it works. The humor in this show reflects the dark humor in the game.Overall, I was unexpectedly impressed and satisfied by Fallout. I went into it with no expectations hoping that it would be great and it turned out to be something amazing. It's an incredibly well-made and put together show that's worth watching regardless if you've played the games or not. Highly highly recommend it.",9
The review bombs - assumptions and speculation by social media,"As someone who played Fallout, Fallout 2-4, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter - the review bombs need to be addressed. No where was it stated that Bethesda or anyone else admitted to or stated that the show would follow the Video Game titles timeline or synopsis. A whole bunch of nonsense was generated online and social media about this, and people just gulped it up under the guise - ""Well its on the internet, it must be true!""Ha! Sure.....Anyways, I'm at the halfway point of the series and I am impressed just the way it is. It's refreshing sometimes when you get a different portrayal that a rehashed timeline you are already so used to you could recite it in your sleep.Fallout is a wonderful transition from Video Game to physical acting concept. It kept the mainline of events of nuclear holocaust and living in a strange but familiar world devastated by the power of the Atom.Ignore the reviews bombs.",9
An apocalypse story without zombies?,"One of the best things about Fallout is discovering the reason behind the vaults and those who pioneered its creation. It starts out as surface dwellers are evil, barbaric and crazy while the vault dwellers are civil and well mannered but this isn't entirely the case. I haven't played the games so slowly discovering the truth was a rewarding experience for me. Lucy and Maximus are great and their journey is interesting but the ghoul is the one who piqued my interest the most. What happened to his wife and daughter? They're clearly both still alive and how on earth did he survive for 200 years??? The reunion between the ghoul and his wife is something to look forward too as she betrayed him by lying to him about the vaults and the bombs. Speaking of ghouls, what's with feral ghouls annd chicken? 😂 Anyways the ghouls are pretty human until they turn feral annd then they're zombie like, I mean what apocalyptic story is complete without zombies? Then there's Norm, Lucy's cowardly brother whose acts of courage reveal so much to us. The apocalypse is filled with strange and interesting characters and fallout fully embraces that.There's a lot about vaulttec that hasn't been uncovered and I honestly wish I could get a season 2 right now!",9
I wasn't expecting this Show,"I wasn't expecting this Show at all, and I Loved It. I hope to see the next season of it, to know what's coming next. I really want to see what would happen to Lucy to the Ghoul I mean wow it was amazing of a show. And now I wanna play the game maybe some time. The thing is I'm waiting for the continuation. Really excited. I recommend this to many people. Talking a bit about it, all the Setting and the story of every character was really perfect. I've played the game a little bit, just a bit and I see the world really well constructed . My final comment is just a big wow for this show. Love..!",10
Truly outstanding!,"Amazon nailed it this time. What didn't work at all with ""Rings of Power"" works perfectly with this gaming adaptation. ""Fallout"" promises an exciting journey through post-apocalyptic worlds. Starting with the consistently good casting, you get a truly consistent and believable, albeit twisted, world presented here. Ella Purnell stands out particularly positively, perfectly fitting into the role of competent and motivated, yet highly naive Vault-Dweller Lucy with her large doe eyes. Walton Goggins as the mysterious cowboy. The horror and gore elements are gross but fitting. Even without knowing the games, the series is truly outstanding. Can wholeheartedly recommend. Want more of it... immediately!",8
Preachy Hollywood Garbage,"This is really bad. If you are a fan of the game, do not watch this. Pure LA morally superior preachy crap. Everyone that watches this isn't a gamer. This is terrible. I wanted it to be good so bad because I love the game, but it is absolutely horrible. I watched to the end just because I thought somehow it would recover. You are wasting your life if you watch this BS. Everyone is talking about this like it's a good gamer film. False. The new MK is a good gamer film. Assassin's creed was pretty damn good. This nonsense is so into itself it's pathetic. It's preachy, it's vain and it has nothing to do with the game.",
Above Average,"Created by Geneva Roberts and Graham Wagner for Amazon Prime, we follow Lucy MacLean (Ella Purnell), an underground vault dweller hundreds of years after nuclear war has destroyed most the surface of the globe. A story familiar for fans of the games, Lucy must adventure to the surface to rescue her father and discover what kind of civilization is left intact in the irradiated, monster-ridden world above. As a show there are considerable shortcomings, but ultimately quite a good time. A franchise based around heavy world building the show hits the ground running introducing us to the lore and the backstory, through the lens of 4 or so characters in places and times. Again for those already familiar with the games this rapid catch-up may seem fine, however a series introduction the opening is considerably blocky, with strange pacing, and frankly weird dialogue. As someone who has played much of the games, there's a lot to be said on the production choices around which were to give that ""video game"" feel, however I don't like many of those choices, personally. Characters only interacts as if its a Bethesda engine, lots of standing and talking, sitting and talking, or walking and talking. Characters never have business, or things to practically do, in scenes. And the opposite, during any scenes of movement or action montages we get basically zero dialogue, sometimes for minutes at a time. If really does feel like watching a video game at points, in a subtle way the bad first-person scenes in the new Halo adaptation didn't even capture. However these choices may certainly appeal to some and they certainly seem to, totally fair. There are also tons of references to things across all the games, which was neat, although ascetically its of course continuing into the heavier saturation, Todd Howard version of the Fallout universe, most prominent now in the styles of the games 76 and Shelter, which again of course makes sense as he serves as a producer. Some practical props were hit and miss, as was the CGI. Things in scenes and backgrounds tended to look great, however hero props the characters actually held were often very cardboard / rubber looking. And I don't wanna talk about the de-aging CGI. Narratively as we progress the series improves although as story twist after story twist comes, especially towards the end, I didn't mind them, they just rarely felt justified by what lead up to it. That said the set pieces and wardrobe are all great, I was extremely impressed. Acting is all suitable, Purnell as Lucy was good, I of course loved Walton Goggins' performance. Ultimately a pretty fun story that does eventually come together once it gets going, although I expect may be a bit confusing or lacking for those completely unfamiliar with the lore from the games. I liked it, didn't love it, but will definitely check out the next season whenever that comes.",6
Authentic Fallout experience brought to your TV screen,"As a fan with combined of 3000+hrs across all Fallout games I have a huge smile watching this as Jonathan Nolan understands what Fallout truly is. After the The Last of Us dissapointment it's truly refreshing to have a director who actually has had a Fallout addiction just as we fans and it translates beautifully to the TV screen.You have three storylines brought together in funny and goofy ways just as it should be. Ella Purnell as the naive Vault dweller, Walton Goggins as the Ghoul and Aaron Moten as the glorious Brotherhood of Steel squire. These 3 absolutely nail their roles and bring out the subtle details from the game, all the way from their skills/perks to their personality and it actually feels like we are following Fallout characters.The world is dreadful, but beautiful filled with abominations and silliness, dark humor with a sense of danger at every corner. This is THE best video game adaptation ever made easily by a mile and will definitely make you interested in the games.",10
Last episode is Great! but the Dog has the best plot...,"A harsh review- Though I might have come back from seeing Dune 2 :)Gets better after episode 4...The intrigue in flashback scenes are great- but that doesnt mean the rest is, which is the main bulk of the story.Plot follows the main actress as she learns the harsh way of the surface and below. Her brother as he questions life in the vault. We follow a man 'gone rogue' from a militant faction and his life choices. And finally an ex human now ghoul travel the wastelands by his lonesome.Coincidences galore... and gore galore.Starts like many sheltered societies after a devastating event (Silo, Raised by Wolves, Snowpiercer) and the mystery unfolds....
though, those shows are more interesting...(Trivia: the font of main title are from the Fallout Games)",6
Bad writing toward the end ruins it,"As someone who has played FO1, 2, 3, and New Vegas, they nailed the tone and world building.As someone who likes actually good writing, this show fell flat on its face. Hard.Oddly enough, the storytelling here was relatively solid. Good characterization. The tone, as mentioned. A nice blend of cartoonish dark humor and grit.But in a rare twist of modern literature, it's the plot that is a problem. The plot became so nonsensical by the end that it wrecked the first half of the series.First, the reveal of how Vault 31/32/33 operate means that Hank must have known of the destruction of 32. Yet he let in the raiders.Second, Moldaver and Hank had history, and he STILL let in the raiders.Third, the show simply handwaves how Moldaver, who had a massive falling out with Vault Tech, somehow survived 200 years.Fourth, Hank nuked - NUKED - a whole city because his wife ran away? A hard pill to swallow... and a bridge to far when you remember he's been in cryo for 200 years and underground his whole life. Snap! Nuke!There plot issues that exist after you sit and think about it. And then there's issues that make you stop in the middle of the show and make you rewatch the foundational pieces to make sure you didn't miss something.Fallout is squarely in the latter category.While there is enough in the show to enjoy the journey, it wants to tell a cohesive story, and it does not. It's not a series of side quests. That brings the show way down in my book.If you can overlook foundational concerns like this, you'll enjoy the show.",5
"Never heard of the game - still, this is the BEST apocalyptic show I've ever seen!","I've never heard or played the game. I started watching based on the reviews, and I was simply blown away!! The series keeps you on your edge and captivated through a really deep and surprising storyline that keeps you guessing every single episode. There are no fillers - the plot is interesting through and through. Also there are no ""smoke and mirrors"" just to keep you guessing like some shows that change the plot for the sake of change and stretch it out like bubble gum (e.g. Lost).Character build up is great - the protagonists all have interesting storylines and plots. And yes of course there's action (and plenty of gore!) as is fitting for an apocalyptic series. This ain't no love movie!The setting also blew me away, probably more familiar to those who've played the games. A mix of advanced technology together with nostalgic times - they don't have iphones and TV are black and white. I won't add so as not to spoil.Note that it does have plenty of gore and dark humor, wouldn't recommend for young kids. If you're not a very young kid - go watch it now!",10
Impeccable transfer from game to tv,"Been an avid fallout player since the waterchip broke in fallout 1.The suspense and whirlwind of feelings I had waiting to see how prime would handle the task of transferring fallout to the tv-screen has been a rollercoaster.The series deliver with a cast that surely shows the importance of a good casting director.The scenery and environment was so well done there surely would be an Oscar in the waiting if this was a movie adaptation.I don't think I have seen such good cgi in a tv-series ever. Only think I reacted to was the young version of Overseer Hank.Following the different storylines was a real treat and the occasional humorous additions was spot on.The only negative thing is now I have a long wait until season 2, never wanted a kryo tube this bad....",10
Surprisingly good!,"I'm a huge fan of the games. I played Fallout 1 & 2 in the 90s, and Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4 later on (New Vegas is my favorite, but I love them all, yes even 4). I only briefly played Tactics and never tried 76.Anyway, this show is actually way better than I expected! It absolutely nails the tone of the games. The production design is fantastic. Some of the actual filmmaking is a little mixed, with a few scenes struggling when it comes to basic blocking and framing, but overall this is top tier work with a great cast. Walton Goggins is a standout, this is one of his best roles. There's some really nice character writing, too, and actual character growth.I know there's been some controversy with the changes made to the lore, especially in the last episode, but I actually think they handled it well, making the revelations near the end a satisfying character moment with some real emotional stakes to it. This isn't a perfect show, of course, but there's wayyyy more to like than not like, and as a fan of the games, I'm genuinely surprised how well this turned out. The production values are decent, the character writing and casting is great, and the tone is spot on; that's all I can ever ask for from an adaptation (or continuation) of something I love.Would love to see games like BioShock, Mass Effect, Deus Ex, Dishonored and Half-Life get the same sort of treatment.",8
Absolutely Perfect.,"Fallout has always been one of my absolute favorite video games series of all time. And this show did not disappoint, from start to finish I was hooked, and it genuinely felt like the shows curators understood the assignment. I cannot wait for season two, and honestly the only negative thing I can say about the show is it was too short! Very much looking forward to watching this season a few more times to look for any fun little easter eggs I missed the first time around. If you love the games, or just enjoy crazy post apocalyptic type of shows, this one is perfect and I cannot recommend it enough!",10
A competent adaptation,"I'll be the first to admit that I was expecting a let down. Especially with Hollywood's recent track record of going ballistic on any IP they get their hands on.This then being a video-game adaptation, which are usually ranging from utter failure to let downs, the stage was set to this being just another one of the bunch.But apparently someone's been doing their homework, because they actually managed to create a pretty decent story in the Fallout lore, and also deliver a visually authentic experience to go hand in hand with the writing.Now this isn't the greatest show ever conceived by all means, but what it set out to deliver, it delivered it well.All the actors had done great job with their roles, special shout out to Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins as the stand-outs.The music was absolutely spot on, simply due to them being literally ripped out of the games, so the nostalgia hits any fan instantly.And last but not least, to avoid spoilers, the show full of a vault worth easter eggs for the fans to find.If they can keep this momentum and attention to detail for a few more seasons, this could actually go down as the best video-game adaptation to date.",8
"Not bad, but oh. my. god. is it slow","I cant say it was bad, the world was really well done the graphics were more then great.The story is just so unbelievably bad and slow its a tough watch after 6/7 episodes.After watching half the season, you get your action drama and dark stuff but the story wont PROGRESS AT. ALL.It feels like you are stuck in the desert for 7 hours.The acting was great, Maximus's acting i wasn't a big fan of but cant all be perfect regarding that.I just wish we'd actually see more of the fallout world, but instead its just small glimpses giving u small tastes of what it could be and its utterly disappointing not reaching that climax.",
Good entertainment. Mediocre everything else,"I have played most of the fallout games and really like the series. When I first heard about this I wasn't too sure how to feel about it. The film industry is famous for not keeping true to the source material or inserting their own agenda into the films.With that being said, I found the show to be better than expected but there are some areas I found lacking.Quality on production is great. However, there are several scenes throught the season where the film locations look just like other locations in different episodes. Also, many of the scenes make the wasteland feel small in comparison to the open world game.I also felt like the dialogue was weak in areas. Another annoyance was seeing characters both background and main characters both make terrible choices. Choices that are so bad they would have to intentionally make the bad choice because doing anything else would have been better. I dont want to give any spoilers but you will notice when you watch if you havent alreadyIt seems like several scenes that occurred only did so to drive story which didnt feel needed as the story was simple and straight forwardOverall if your a fan of the series or post apocalyptic genre fan or just looking for something light you may get enjoyment out of it. If your looking for a series more engaging with a better script and sensibility then you may want to look elsewhere.",7
Great adaptation of a video game.,"Over the last 30ish years there have been a lot of movie adaptations of video games and more recently series based on games. This is without a doubt the best adaptation I have seen. Great writing, great acting, great set design and overall aesthetic. They obviously spent a lot of time making sure that they got it right. It's funny, dramatic, intense and completely engrossing. Definitely a huge achievement for the genre and something for others to aspire to when adapting a game to TV/movie. I binged the whole season nonstop and it was time well spent. I recommend this to everyone...you don't need to have played the game to enjoy this show.",9
Not bad but could be better,"I've loved the Fallout universe since the first game. Post-apocalyptic but not quite sci-fi. The show really nailed the scene and supplied a decent plot, but some of the acting and dialogue was just...off, and dry as the wasteland itself. It also tried to inject too much humor - Fallout is a more serious game, but the show keeps trying to make us laugh.I really want to like the show, so we'll see if I can make it through the whole thing. At least they got the general feeling right, from the general item names to the various groups of people. It just seems like they should've hired some better writers.",7
DUMB. SLOW. NOT GOOD.,"Disclosure: I know nothing about the game, nor do I care about the game. I watched this with no clue and no expectations.So, obviously its for teens. Gamers? Viewers who like robot-ey things and senseless violence. Im not offended or grossed out, its just all kind of silly.This reminded me alot of 1995's Tank Girl, but longer, slower, and more dramatic. None in a good way (not saying that Lori Petty movie was great, but it was quick and fun for what it was)
This is not a good show. It jumps around between groups, environments, slowly tries to bring in a plot....maybe. The underground, bunkered people are afraid to go to the surface...where people seem to be living just fine? Huh?I guess its just not interesting enough for me to continue past the first couple of episodes.2 stars instead of 1 for the cool sci-fi angle.",2
"Stick with it, it grows on you","""Fallout,"" the 2024 film adaptation of the iconic video game series, takes viewers on a rollercoaster ride through a post-apocalyptic landscape that at first feels overwhelming but gradually becomes endearing. Directed by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the movie captures the essence of the game while creating a unique cinematic experience that stands on its own. For those unfamiliar with the game, like myself, the initial experience might seem peculiar, but persistence pays off as the narrative and characters begin to resonate deeply.At the outset, ""Fallout"" can be disorienting. The film thrusts viewers into a desolate world ravaged by nuclear war, where remnants of humanity struggle to survive amidst mutated creatures and hostile factions. The visual aesthetic is stark and grim, echoing the desolation and chaos of a world where civilization has crumbled. The barren landscapes, dilapidated buildings, and eerie silence can feel overwhelming and bizarre, especially for those who have not been immersed in the game's lore.However, as the story progresses, the initial sense of bewilderment gives way to fascination. The film follows the journey of the protagonist, played by Walton Goggins, a lone wanderer navigating this treacherous new world. Goggins' portrayal of the protagonist is compelling; he brings a rugged charisma and depth to the character, making his struggle for survival relatable and engaging. His interactions with other characters, including the enigmatic Ghoul played by Ella Purnell and the resourceful scavenger portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan, add layers of complexity to the narrative.One of the film's strengths lies in its character development. Initially, the characters might appear as mere archetypes in a dystopian setting, but as the plot unfolds, their backstories, motivations, and relationships come to the fore. Purnell's character, in particular, evolves from a mysterious figure to a pivotal part of the protagonist's journey, revealing a rich history and a poignant vulnerability. MacLachlan's scavenger, on the other hand, brings a touch of dark humor and resilience, adding depth and diversity to the ensemble cast.The movie also excels in its world-building. The directors have meticulously crafted a universe that feels both expansive and intimate. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and special effects creates an immersive experience that draws viewers deeper into the story. The depiction of various factions, from the ruthless Raiders to the enigmatic Brotherhood of Steel, adds layers of intrigue and conflict, enriching the narrative tapestry.Another highlight is the film's soundtrack, composed by Ramin Djawadi. The music perfectly complements the film's tone, ranging from hauntingly melancholic melodies that underscore the desolation of the wasteland to more upbeat, adventurous tunes that accompany the protagonist's journey. Djawadi's score enhances the emotional impact of key scenes, making the viewing experience more immersive and memorable.""Fallout"" is not without its flaws. The pacing in the first act can be slow, and the dense exposition might feel heavy-handed for those unfamiliar with the source material. However, these minor drawbacks are overshadowed by the its strengths. The narrative's gradual unfolding allows for a deeper connection with the characters and the world they inhabit, making the eventual payoff all the more satisfying.In conclusion, ""Fallout"" is a film that rewards patience and engagement. For those willing to stick with it, the initial strangeness transforms into a captivating and emotionally resonant experience. The richly developed characters, immersive world-building, and evocative soundtrack come together to create a movie that stands out in the crowded landscape of video game adaptations. Whether you're a fan of the game or a newcomer to the franchise, ""Fallout"" offers a unique and compelling cinematic journey that will grow on you with each passing moment.",8
Not a gamer !,"First of all I would like to highlight that I haven't play the game, I just knew for its existence. So my review is based clearly on the serie and nothing else.I'm a fan of the vintage vibe, I love everything of the 60'. I also love movies and series that refers to a post-apocalyptic world, so as you understand this serie it's the best combination for me and it didn't disappoint me at all. It's a very well made, the production is amazing. I loved the cinematography and the music of the 60', you get definitely to the mood which I believe is the half of the serie. The acting of the cast is also good, nothing special but yet not disappointed. As I know there will be another season and I'm glad for it because not all of your questions are get an answer. It's a kind of a serie that will make you play the game eventually and as I heard the sales of the game have been increased after the launch of the serie.I would definitely recommend to watch it either you played the game or not!!!",8
This show is GOLD,"The show is incredible truly! I've played several of the Fallout games and it's impeccably crafted to mirror the origin world of the games. Whatever GENIUS suggested Walton Goggins this role nailed it, damn. His work just creeps up on you and grows from Boyd Crowder to Sherrif Chris Mannix to Baby Billy Freeman and now the Ghoul Cooper Howard is right in his channel of Forte. Its a sort of cringe to look, but you have to watch. I only have the suggestion for this show to craftily bring in the missing Death Claws and Super Mutants and you'll get a hardline 10. One of the two best re-creations of a fabricated world ever, I think the details stand tall & solid. Creating in a class I can only compare to The Last of Us, the depth is correct in all the right ways. In the last episode I almost died when the robot said ""wait, wait, wait, I won't answer your questions unless you let me inject you with THIS."" Keep this show rolling, don't make us wait years to see the rest of whats coming.",9
One of the best live action shows based on video games.,"From start to finish, this is very good. The characters are super cool to watch and the story makes them progress very well. Also, the ghoul is one of the coolest characters in general. I also thought Norm's storyline was more interesting and I was more invested in his story all the way until the final episode or so.Also, watching the ghoul in both the wasteland and pre-bomb was super cool.Another one of my favorite things is the world design. It just feels like fallout, even all the things that would normally feel goofy in other shows just feel normal in this world.This is definitely one of my favorite series' to come out recently.",9
"The creators behind Fallout manages to do the near impossible in making a perfect video game adaptation, a spectacular and entertaining season of television","My experience with Fallout through the years was by playing the games, Fallout: New Vegas being the game that brought me into the franchise. It's set in the same state as this show, California (which also featured prominently in Fallout 1 and 2). Lore wise, both before and after the apocalypse, it was just the right choice by the showrunners and producers to place it in Los Angeles, California. Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet served as showrunners for the show, penning the scripts for episode 1-3. Then there were a couple of other writers which deserves praise; Kieran Fitzgerald, Chaz Hawkins and Gursimran Sandhu. The creators and crew behind this tv show respected the source material (the games) with even Todd Howard aboard as producer, along with Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy with Nolan directing the first three episodes thus setting the tone for what's to come like Michael Mann did with Tokyo Vice for example. Other notable directors were Clare Kilner and Frederick E. O. Toye along with Wayne Yip who directed the finale. These people created something truly special and perfect, what I would call one of the best adaptations of video games. It's an original story but set in the same universe, something The Last of Us and Halo never did, these writers and producers of Fallout could have played it safe and done something similar as they would have had free rein to do anything they wanted to, without the need of involving the games and all lore behind it. They truly nailed the attention to detail, from the set design to the world building, the overall production design and everything placed on the scene. Truly incredible mise-en-scene by the directors. Visually, Fallout is spectacular. With incredible cinematography and gorgeous looking visual effects combined with practical effects, the makeup and prosthetics for The Ghoul for example along with all the sets built for the show, like Red Rocket and Super-Duper Mart which comes to mind. The cinematographers who worked on the show(season) was
Stuart Dryburgh who helmed four and Teodoro Maniaci who helmed the other four, I think Dryburgh's cinematography was the best and his resume (The Piano, the pilot episode for Boardwalk Empire and The Painted Veil) speaks for itself, he'll probably get nominated for Fallout too. Maniaci was also incredible, creating some iconic shots for the last two episodes.The show depicts the aftermath of the Great War of 2077, an apocalyptic nuclear exchange in an alternate history of Earth where advances in nuclear technology after WWII led to the emergence of a retrofuturistic society and a subsequent resource war. Flashforward to 2296, this TV adaptation follows a young woman named Lucy who leaves behind her home in Vault 33 to venture out into the dangerously unforgiving wasteland of a devastated Los Angeles to look for her father. Along the way, she meets a Brotherhood of Steel squire and a ghoul bounty hunter, each with their own mysterious pasts and agendas to settle.Original Fallout lead Tim Cain appreciated the performances and storytelling, but singled out how the show nailed the Fallout ""vibe"" as its biggest achievement. ""I was just looking at all the props,"" he said of one scene. ""I realized after a few minutes went by that I had not followed the dialogue at all, because I was so engrossed by it visually."" and I couldn't agree more, hearing this from one of the creators of the original Fallout games just makes me smile. The performances and storytelling are truly some of the highlights, the comedic tone combined with ultra-violence was handled perfectly as it was close to the games. The show also had a serious tone, but the important thing is how everything felt natural and never strange to the viewer's eyes. The storytelling, overall writing and narrative was completely right for the tv show; having us follow a Vault Dweller, perfectly cast and a three dimensional character in her own right, Ella Purnell as Lucy MacLean. Then there is the squire Maximus of the Brotherhood of Steel, also a great character and well cast, played by Aaron Moten. Then we have Walton Goggins as The Ghoul / Cooper Howard, a great three dimensional antagonist which crosses the morally grey on multiple occasions thus becoming a protagonist in his own right. That's the big three with stories from deuteragonists also. There's also a big mystery surrounding the season/show, of who took Lucy's father and who destroyed Shady Sands, along with Howard which is hunted by every faction and bounty hunters after escaping the Enclave with something valuable. Meanwhile there's another story, flashbacks more exactly which shows The Ghoul back before the bombs hit, when he was Cooper Howard and timeline wise this is far from anything we have seen before and it was just brilliantly executed in a way that didn't hurt the pacing, only made it better because of how it ties into the main story. With a stellar main cast of characters impossible not to like, the supporting cast and guest stars are also great with names like; Sarita Choudhury, Leslie Uggams, Matt Berry, Chris Parnell and Michael Cristofer.The final episode (1.08) ties everything together nicely, both timelines, and well everything comes full circle in that said episode in its twists and so on. Having a lot of knowledge of the lore, lots of things weren't a shock but the show's big twist was unexpected and brilliant. The writers and showrunners deserve a lot of praise for the last episode and the whole show, the faithfulness to the source material and succeeding in telling a story in its vast universe. It would have been nice if they would have released weekly episodes, so you get to savor every minute of an episode in a day which would have felt special, but instead we got all eight episodes and honestly I was happy for it but deep down I miss the whole weekly release and socializing which comes with it. Fallout is getting a second season and I'm here to stay, for now I'm giving the first season my thumbs up, it's a spectacular season of television and possibly the best time I've had watching a TV series in a long time. It's a multi genre show and Fallout does it perfectly, nailing each genre, simply a spectacular season of television.",10
"Comedic, dark, violent and a nail biting story","Having played the games the show follows the lore well whilst also being unique. We have interesting characters all with their own traits and quirks whilst also having their own unique agendas. The comedy had me laughing so hard my lungs felt like they were gonna fail especially after meeting some of the funniest wastelanders. Whilst the show has a funny twisted side to it, it also has a dark gritty story and as you watch through you're left on the edge of your seat wondering what your protagonist are going to reveal next. You don't need to have played the games to watch the show everything that needs explaining is explained throughout the story to help viewers who are new to the fallout world.Overall Fallout plays all its cards right managing to combine its amazing characters, hilarious comedy, stunning sets, violent nature of the post-war wasteland and keeping true the Fallout theme of everything is not as it seems without seeming like a huge joke.I cant recommend this show enough.",9
Attempts to upgrade the zombie apocalypse genr,"The latest, much-publicized science fiction blockbuster series is ""Fallout"", now streaming on Prime and Freevee (without and with ads, respectively; both are from Amazon). It stars Ella Purnell as Lucy MacLean, Walter Coggins as the mutant bandit ghoul, and Aaron Moten as love interest Maximus. While it is getting a high rating of 8.7 on IMDB I would rate it a barely watchable 6.0. The plot is that VaultTec, a manufacturer of fallout shelters, has conspired with other powerful interests to start a nuclear war in order to drive customers into its shelters. Some 200 years later the surface is inhabited by warring remnants of humanity as well as mutated monsters. This series is based on a popular video game and feels as juvenile as one might therefore expect in spite of its multimillion dollar production. It is not so much science fiction as it is one which is only a couple steps above being a zombie apocalypse film. There are all sorts of plot holes (e.g., how is it with surface obliterated back into the stone age, electricity seems to be working in every abandoned building and high-tech weaponry proliferates). Characters are stereotyped and inauthentic. I also wearied of combining ultraviolent visuals with retro nostalgic singing. I did watch all eight episodes but I think one must be a sci-fi or gaming addict to do so.",6
Do not listen most 13-17 Years old teenager's comments,"Nowadays as you know new gen getting more toxic. People hate everything without reason. This is the one of product people just hate randomly. I don't like Bethesda games and I didint want to watch this show. But when I started this the one of the best adaptation and tv show nowadays. Extremely fun and gore and so many things. I definitely enjoyed all episodes yes some part of script very bad yet still great shows. If you are not capable to understand tv shows, movies, game just stop and go find different hobbies. This world doesn't for you. As I said people who rated lower than 7 don't believe it and just ignore those comments. 7-10 is appropriate for this show.",10
A solid series for fans of post-apocalyptic sci-fi.,"After binge watching all episode, here is my honest review of Season 1 of Fallout.I've heard of the games, but never got around to actually play them, so my review is based with little to no influence from the games.Fallout is a decent and quite captivating series, only let down by some bad main casting choices, except Goggins, and sometimes wtf moments (like that doctor not getting hit by a single bullet from a robot controlled sentry gatling gun) That was outright the dumbest thing I've ever seen on screen.Episodes 1-3 starts off slow and I felt at times I wanted to stop, but I managed through, and the flashback scenes actually help me keep my interest even more mainly because of Cooper's backstory.The series really kicks off from EP04 and I didn't feel like there was any kind of filler moments, which really made the viewing experience much more to the point.I loved Goggins character Cooper, and his backstory is really the drive in Fallout. Actually the only character I cared and rooted for.Lucy on the other hand, was 'meh' at best. Her dialogue delivery felt sooo... ""robotic"". Character was fine, and I like that they didn't make her to much of ""power girl"" and showed her moments of mistakes.Maximus - I just didn't care for. Dude looks dumb founded half the time. His squeaky voice doesn't fit his character at all. And as of character development goes (almost none btw), I wish he developed a bit more to a badass after all he went through, but no. He remained the same all through.Oh yeah - and don't get me started on that non-binary character. I almost turned it off when the pronouns came out, but luckily her screen time is limited and is only in 2 episode.Overall Fallout is a well made series with a intriguing plot and some decent VFX. Of what I know about the games, this honestly might be the one of the best game to screen adaptation I've seen.7/10.",7
"Not the First, Not the Best... At anything","First of all let me start by saying I just rewatched Twin Peaks. To watch another TV show after that is sort of like eating a big ice cream sundae right before dinner.But, it really helps to put it into perspective how bad this production is. Let's start from the first scenes of pre fallout world. There is no time to feel suspense at all about impending doom. We have no feelings for any of the characters. We have five minutes of slow mo at a children's birthday party. It's like the writers of the show are just saying ""how can we get there fastest?"" and things are tossed into the script to serve a purpose for the writers. A good writer could make an entire season about pre fallout world.Why am I mentioning this? Because the entire show is like this. This is the dialogue between writers:
"" people need to die. ""
"" who?""
"" I don't know, write them into the script so that they CAN die. It serves a function to get us to X""""bombs need to fall""
""how?""
""who cares, just make bombs happen. We need them to get to X""We don't care about the deaths. And the violence is endless. Just be prepared to watch people you don't care about and know nothing about die constantly.The show skips from one scene to the next like a baboon with ADD. And that is the major difference between a good show like Twin Peaks and a waste of time like Fallout. We aren't forced to deal with ANY unwanted or uneasy emotions for any significant period of time in Fallout. Just think about that for a minute because part of that is the exact reason why people watch TV. It's called catharsis! The concept has been around for millennia.Its not the first or best show to do anything it attempts. The humor falls flat. The ghoul is cliché. The dialogue is not memorable.. It's a blood bath. This show will make you stupid.",3
Wonderful,"I was very suspicious in nowaday Fallout, cause nowadays are not what Fallout was - Fallout is about steampunk 50th of past century, and this is a lot changes since then, even if it is alternative history.So.. 2077, before halloween, bombs dropped out, and world had gone. Almostlike the fourth fallout, yeah.Then we introduced to Shelter 33 in 2296 year, meet Lucy, the one of survivors who's gonna do outer world better! Someday..And then this day came closer. Story of shelter 33 (vault, so as 31 and 32) is good, but not very unique, the third vault had been under same circumctances. If you asked.Everything looks like Fallout here, creators really gave a shot for it. Yet to someone who know no cr..nothing about. . Fallout can be confused, I guess causs it two hundred years of plot (nine years after the games)! But for someone who knows everything it will be still a lot of surpsises.I love it.",10
Goggins Great as Always!,"Goggins is one of my favorite actors, here perfectly cast again. He displays just enough combination of dash, dread, humor, sympathy and quirkiness. He is so unique. Purnell also perfectly cast, showing the naïveness, vulnerability and strength. Wonderful cast all around!The story is a drama, in a dark and light comedy, in a mystery, in a sci-fi. For 200 years after the apocalypse, people live underground in tunnel, built by a commercial self-interested company, and they are ready to get back above ground, but something's wrong, the leader is kidnapped, and it's tough to tell who is actually the good guy and the bad guy, which leads to the complexity and the mystery of the characters and the plot.There's humans, Iron-Man type of soldiers, ghouls, terrible raw state-of-nature humans above ground, a brewing terrible state of sophisticated humans below the ground, a beautiful dog, and creatures, revenge, betrayal and more.As for me, I like all genres of movies, but it seems that this production is balanced enough to attract a very wide audience, even those who might not gravitate toward sci-fi. If you made me choose between this series and the Marvel movies, this is a far better and more engaging story than the best of the Marvel. The reason is that the story and the themes are so well balanced.This is a very well-made production. Great casting, direction, sets, and just a great story well-told. Each episode leaves you wanting more.",9
Awesome!,"I have NEVER watched the video game but have loved the series! It really needs a season two just because season one was so epic. Walton Goggins plays the most excellent role without ever seeing his face but you can't mistake the voice. Ella is a great actress too she plays Lucy in a most excellent role was always rooting for her it's the first time I have seen her in a starring role and she does a bang up job for a heroine you are always rooting for. I vote yes for a season two and maybe even more, it really wants you to binge watch it and so I did, if you haven't already watched season one than I highly recommend you do...!",10
Fantastic.,"Where to start ...gripping,grounded and well written . I have only played fallout 3/4 so my knowledge is limited but this is what adaptation should be . Fan service and writing a original and compelling story , the main cast shine thanks too the script and fx to thier ability to pull you in to there senarios. Only one and small setback for me was the over use of the landscaped I swear we walked past the same place 10 times during this season. That aside every character onscreen shines giving just enough story arc to not make any episode feel like a filler . I really enjoyed this and look forward to the next series well done prime you did have me worried but i loved this series.",10
A big vault boy thumbs up from me,"A pitch perfect rendition of a much loved game series. If you're into the games, it has some brilliant references and nostalgia fuel. If you're not into the games, it still has a compelling narrative, weaving together multiple protagonists, each with their own past and present. Flashbacks provide context and some excellent ""AHA!"" moments. I was genuinely hooked.The casting is brilliant. Each lead is able to capture the dual personalities and conflicts within each character. Although I recognised the likes of Walton Goggins and Kyle MacLachlan, I was still able to fully believe in their characters. And the actors I had hitherto not recognised, deserve to be more well known!The costume and sets are incredibly well crafted and faithful to the source material. There is a sort of beautiful decay to the fallout games and this series captures that. And the score! Music is such a key part of the games, and the series is practically a tutorial on how to pair scenes with pre-existing music.The best ""TV show based on a video game"" ever. It's bucking a trend.",10
Did not disappoint,"For anyone who's finished all the Fallout games, this show is a real treat. It contains numerous nods to the entire Fallout universe, with a special emphasis on references from Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4. The introductions to the major factions and the exploration of the vaults' backstory are particularly well done, blending elements from across the game series into a cohesive and compelling narrative.The show's creators have managed to capture the essence of Fallout, creating a world that feels familiar yet fresh. I'm looking forward to more seasons and episodes, as the show's momentum builds. This could easily become a hit, drawing in new fans and rekindling interest among existing ones. I'm thrilled to see where it goes next-great job, Bethesda!",10
"Very good, but unpleasant.","The show is compelling and intelligent. The themes touched on are timely and intelegent. However it is highly self indulgent with its brutality.Pros:
Characters: the characters are all generally compelling and well realized.Plot: The plot grows and twists throughout the show in a digestible and compelling way. It starts simple and grows well.Message: The show has a good message regarding corruption and power. Especially in regards to monopolies.Cons:
Disgusting: The show seems to revel in just how horrible it can be. It is so consistent that it starts being predictable with its awfulness. The show will show you something nice and cute, then the next moment kill it for dramatic effect just to be awful.Pacing: Inconsistent pacing made me engage then disengage with the show.The show is good, But I didn't enjoy watching it. Which is a very strange feeling.",7
"A fun, beautifully crafted tv show...","Fallout is really good. It's got its moments that will make you laugh and it's got a comedic tone that, instead of making everything feel cartoony, makes everything feel so fun and just a treat. While fallout may seem like just a fun comedy, it is so much more. Fallout takes the original games to a next step and makes everything funnier, more gory, and a very good written story. The various different plot twists hit the landing perfectly and work extremely well to give you the feeling of surprise with every episode. Fallout is the very rare occasion that a game gets the adaptation it deserves!",9
I never played the game....,I never played the game before but the first few episodes are a bit corny. I guess that's the point to make it seem like everything was all peaches and cream in the vault while real life was happening on the surface. Lucy is annoying and is green to everything lol which is expected since she has had a shelter life. Her life kind of reminds me of religion and Lucy is the preachers daughter. I'm a big fan of the ghoul for surviving this long and he's a bad ass gun slinger. Now the iron brotherhood with the foolishness of having a squire running and carrying weapons for a heavily armored knight is just asinine. This part just rubs me the wrong way actually but that's my takeaway from the first 3 episodes.,6
Terrible,"4/10 only because it looks mostly good. Poor casting, bad plot and worse thing is the script. It's like the writers and director overheard a conversation from some people who also overheard a conversation about the Fallout games. There are so many inaccuracies, not written or directed by true fans. Ghouls don't look like ghouls, they are too pretty. All the behaviors and dialogue of the characters are ridiculous. Everything that was obvious attempts at humor was not funny. Everything involving the Brotherhood of Steel is the most disappointing, I hope that some serious changes are made on the writers, director, staff and cast as soon as possible.",4
Its Fallout,"I'm so glad to be able to say it, but the series with all its ups and downs is 101% pure Fallout. I really like the cast - awesome folks!The opening scene was true cinematic Fallout opening. I hope this series only advance Fallout as an IP. There is so much stories to tell, so much creative freedom to use.This is how a movie/series based on a game should be made!!! With utmost respect to what made those games fun and engaging - the story, characters, humor and whatnot.I'm already looking forward to Season 2!Shout out to:
Ella Purnell for being a real vault dweller!Aaron Moten for being paladin Danse!Walton Goggins for being the most awesome game i have met in the fallout universe! Awesome actor!AND FREAKIN' Annabel O'Hagan !",10
Counting minutes,"Amazing to see so many details that you're familiar from. It's very rich and the first episode let you with the desire to see more and more. And you can! It was really nice the introduction of our main characters without being silly. It was just nice to take a look how do they become. And what is expected from them. The landscape is really amazing and the vault... perfect! Such a really good care to details. The gadgets are there, the 1950's atmosphere is there. And Mr Handy is like what we are used to.So, what can I saudade? Definitely, the fallout experience is there and pretty sure you gonna like it.",9

Competing factions with well-thought out motives and characters, in a bleak and oddly beautiful setting, coupled with a healthy dose of satire and you get a truly special show.As an avid player of the games, this adaptation ticks all of my boxes and more, plus the ending really gets me excited for season 2.If you like gritty sci-fi - watch it
If you like somehow campy but not campy sci-fi - watch it
If you like the games - watch it
If you like well written characters and can handle gore - watch it
Seriously, just watch itOkey Dokey.",10
Love it,"I had NO idea this was out untill very recently. Loved everything about it. The characters are awesome and a good pace to the show. There were some things I definitely didn't expect. I also liked that they added some comedy that was actually funny and tasteful. A lot of actors that I've liked in the past. One of my favorite shows now and also a very good game, seems to be just like the games I played. I look forward to seeing the second season and hopefully I don't have to wait so long. Give it a try. I pretty much was all the espisodes in a few days and will probably rewatch it and play the games again.",10
Incredible adaptation!,"So good. I loved all the little details. I was excited, and I didn't assume anything. Because of this I was able to enjoy the show. So fantastic. The humor. The story. The curiosity it creates is phenomenal. So many characters, and stories to be told within this show. I'm someone who gets stuck on one video game for years. Fallout 4 is one of those games. When I say I know every detail I mean it. This show absolutely follows through with those details. I enjoyed the intensity the show also brought as well. The introduction of the raiders was fantastic. Once I realized, I was like. No way! How awesome.",10
EVEN EPISODE 1 IS GREAT,"Havent finished it but it is everything a fallout fan could ever ask for. You get a glimpse in the the world of fallout as if you were playing the videogame. Tho i encourage for viewers to play the videogames. I have only played fallout 4 and its incredible. As a TV series promises a visually captivating post-apocalyptic world, morally complex characters, and thought-provoking narratives. With its rich lore and successful video game adaptations as precedent, the potential for a compelling television adaptation is undeniable. A faithful portrayal of the game's storyline and exploration of its ethical dilemmas could make it the best adaptation of the franchise yet.",10
Good but not great,"I really enjoyed this series. I've never played the games but I felt this was really good in establishing the world of Fallout and they made everything easy to understand. The acting across the board is really well done and the actors were all really well cast.My primary complaint about the series is two things: The first being there isn't a whole lot of character development. Our main characters Lucy, Maximus, and the Ghoul largely end the season on the dame footing where they began. The second being the insular characters are honestly more interesting than the main characters. The doctor is an interesting character whom we just abruptly lose. The radio DJ obsessed with string instruments is one and done. The tonic salesman/doctor ""scientist"" guy pops up and just as quickly disappears. These characters are just here to show how strange this world is, but honestly, they're so good that I found myself wanting more on them and less of the main characters.",7
The best of the works I've seen based on video games!,"The whole season flies by in one breath and I want more.The authors do not hesitate to come up with new character plots and rules of the already existing game world. This is only good for the work. InDespite the fact that not everyone likes the 4-part setting, especially fans of the old parts, but it seems to me that this is the best option when you want to hook as large a percentage of viewers as possible.The plot is interesting. Most of all, I liked the plot twists about the father of one of the main characters and about that Vault Boy.The actors are also pleasing to the eye. It's nice to see both established stars and newcomers.The effects of dismemberment and blood in general are very similar to the TV series The Boys. No wonder, because one service deals with projects. This is only a plus! If it's violence, then it's adult.The music is straight from the four.To summarize, the series can be recommended to all fans of 4 parts, but the rest of the wacky humor (although it was full of isometric parts) can scare away.It is very sad that the season came out so short and we will have to wait more than a year for new episodes. I would like to see the adventures of the heroes in the already famous cities as soon as possible!",9
"A pleasant surprise. Even with the fact that they have lost ""the essence of the wasteland""","Initially, I was preparing for complete failure (today this is the default state). But in anticipation of bad things, surprisingly nothing bad happened. Quite a normal plot (even classic regarding the ""main plot action""). There is no absurd break in the narrative, no strong pull on topics that we would not like to see. Walton Goggins works at 476% and pleases the eyes.A pleasant abundance of fan service, music, costumes, merch and more things like this (sometimes its just looks too ""clean"" for this world and the feeling that they were filming with what they could dig up on ali or ebay for 500 bottle caps)The biggest disadvantage is that there is no atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world and a series of games, there is almost no flair of the culture of America in the 60s. At least there isn't that hopelessness and decay of F1-2. Just regular modern people speaking about regular problems.The actors talk, looks and act like ordinary modern people drinking cappuccino in the center of New York 10 minutes ago. (except experienced ones like Goggins)In our modern world, you will probably find places that look worse and people who have more problems than in this world.Sometimes, against the backdrop of clean suits and regular acting, you will think that YouTubers have made high-quality fan fiction.The series is perfect for those who are not a big fan of realistic post-apocalyptic films, games and books, but loves the comedy of light absurdity. Who wants to look at the surroundings and a fresh perspective on this topic.",7
Weak plot,"The CGI is decent, same for the fight scenes. However, the plot is quite weak, the pacing was very slow, after a while I had to start skipping some scenes.I was really excited when this show was announced given the success of Halo series, I was expecting something similar. This really fell short.I want to believe all the positive reviews are from people who have played the games and are already aware of the backstory. For people like me who haven't played the game yet, the show doesn't do anything to explain the characters or to make you care about anything.Just a dull drawn out movie, with lousy characters. Except the ghoul guy, he really tried to bring life to the movie.",4
Game plus TV show,I have played Fallout 1 to Fallout 76 and i loved playing the game series. If you like the TV series you need to add the games to your library and you will love the game. The TV show captured the essence of the game for non game players to enjoy the story line. The T-60 armored suit i thought was over the top ine detail and looked real. A goul bounty hunter is a great part of the story and never seen that comming. I thought the raiders looked to normal and not someone that had high levels of radition. Looking forward to 2nd season and i hope they add more episodes and answer some questions but Alaska needs to be addressed.,10
They nailed it!!,"No spoilers, no nonsense, just a few facts.This time Amazon nailed it. With a nail gun!!I did not have high hopes for this one based on the current streak that all companies have with productions (bad CGI, bad stories, agendas, no true character development etc) but this time I literally took a Fat Boy to the face :)
(those who got it, got it...)
This is how you bring a female lead character into view and get audiences to love it.She ain't super powered, she ain't badass...she BECOMES one as her story evolves...
The choice of Walton Goggins was masterfully spot on, although I know people initially had doubts, but the man is amazing!! Bravo!To top it off, there is huge fan service with all sorts of goodies from the game franchise.And they keep the lore!!! That was a first!!!It seriously gets you hooked for season 2 because the three main characters and all the supporting ones have stories! You get to see development! And background.All in all, this is a great show if you are used to good shows and a masterpiece amidst a sea of mostly mediocrity!That is how it's done!!",10
Entertaining and want more.,"This show is fun and entertaining to watch. The directors know how to shoot a scene and make it impactful. The characters are interesting, the screenplay is good and the world is interesting as well. I would recommend to watch this series. Also as a fan of the games the adaptation is faithful to the source material. It is good to see the creators of the show care about the source material. The show doesn't follow the story of any of the previous games, rather it is a continuation and takes place some time after the events of fallout 4. I am happy with the job they have done and would like to see more seasons in the future.",10
I LOVE IT AS MUCH AS THE GAMES!!,"Having played and delved into the world of Fallout, I was blown away by the sheer quality and attention to detail present in this TV series. It feels as though the creators have seamlessly translated elements directly from the game into the visual medium, capturing the essence of the Fallout universe with remarkable accuracy.Contrary to the criticism, I found the narrative to be perfectly in line with the tone and logic of the games. Every seemingly absurd coincidence pays homage to the nonsensical yet captivating nature of the Fallout universe, serving as a delightful nod to fans.One of the series' greatest strengths lies in its characters, who expertly embody the contrast between vault-dwellers and those living beyond the confines of the vaults. Their depth and complexity add layers to the storytelling, enriching the viewer's experience and drawing them further into the world of Fallout.As I watched each episode, I found myself transported back to my childhood, reminiscing about the countless hours spent exploring the wasteland and forging unforgettable memories in the games. The series masterfully captures the spirit of the Fallout franchise, evoking a sense of nostalgia and wonder that is truly magical.I particularly admire how the creators portray the randomness and mystique inherent in the Fallout games, effectively building suspense and intrigue throughout the series. Every unexpected twist and turn adds to the immersive experience, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats until the very end.What I also loved was the flashbacks to pre-war where the viewer learn more about the ramp up to atomic war.In summary, Fallout is a triumph in every sense of the word, with no discernible flaws to speak of. It is a testament to the talent and dedication of its creators, who have succeeded in bringing the beloved game series to life in a way that is both faithful and exhilarating. Fans of Fallout, old and new alike, owe it to themselves to experience this remarkable series!",10
"Fun cast, great production design","I haven't played the game the series is based on, so its fealty to game lore, I can't say. However, as a big fan of Walton Goggins, this was another fun time. Purnell was strikingly beautiful throughout, and each of the cast members were either dashing and lovely, or delightfully crude. The production design was first class, ironic, and easy on the eyes. Even the tragic dystopian wastelands. The gore is pretty intense, yet at the same time often hilariously executed. No pun intended.The music supervisor should get a medal as period music throughout is truly some of the best of the era, often placed with ironic counterpoint to the action and yet at the same time at some level ghostly in its reminder that in this worldbuilding, culture were suddenly frozen as billions were extinguished...in the Fallout. Fun series.",9
"Tons of fan service but very open ended, kind of like the source material","Straight of the bat you're thrown into the world of Fallout, and that intro is really, one of the best intros I've seen any piece of media. It's just a pity those initial scenes were so limited, sort of like the first sip from a cool Nuka-Cola.I wish I cared more about the characters and plot but they really just feel like 2D cardboard cutouts serving the purpose of tour guides to show us the world of Fallout. They do a really good job at this but as a result I they do little to make you care about them.There's also like zero original soundtracks for the show, relying on preexisting soundtracks which were heavily used in the source material, once again reinforcing the idea that the show is relying heavily on the fan service element.It has great action sequences and world building but beyond that, it leaves much to be desired regarding the world of Fallout.",7
Mediocre with good visuals and a bad script,"Let me say right off the bat that I'm not a fan of the video game series and only partially know about it. Watching this series, I was learning about the universe from scratch. And I liked something, but mostly not.I want to note the good visuals. A lot of different visual details related to the universe. Music and atmosphere in the spirit of the game. Good acting. And... that's it.I found the first episode terrible in so many ways, namely: the dialogs are strange, it looks dragged out, it's done well enough at the same time, but also with amateurish moments; the performances are clumsy, the soundtrack in some places didn't like, there are illogical moments of the script, and most importantly - the world doesn't seem natural. I can't believe in this world given the fantasy of what's going on until the very end of season 1, although it became more interesting to watch as the plot progressed. Sure, the script is pretty okay at some points, but for the most part it doesn't shine with reason. The graphics towards the end of season 1 are of lesser quality than in the beginning. To me, as a person completely unfamiliar with the universe, hyperbolizing, not explained from the first series about this world and how everything is arranged in detail. Having watched 1 season to the end, I'm sure that I don't understand all the things in the universe.The series is extremely overrated by video game fans, in my opinion. I don't see why the series has an 8.6 except for the visuals matching the universe, characters, music, and atmosphere. The authors tried to recreate the universe, and judging by the fans they succeeded, but the script of the series itself brings it down to the level of mediocre series, destroying the interest in such a story.",8
Rating 6 for technical script repetitions,"My grade was 6 because I judged the series with a technical eye, and I came to the conclusion that technically the series' script is standardized and predictable, at several moments I was able to deduce what was going to happen. Other than that, the series has a good pace at times, at others not so much like the last episode of the first season where at times the scenes were very slow. The positive points are the scenarios, battles, references to the game, the humor and the atmosphere. The script between the future and the past was ok. The final revelation that the protagonist's father is behind everything was really cool. The script greatly favors the protagonists, so it is clear that it is a predictable and ok script. The creatures are a good positive point, but we didn't have many on the scene. The ending leaves a hint for a possible season. Well, there are several points to consider but I will just leave these comments from my perspective.",6
Hard to believe...,"...a Nolan was responsible for this disjointed mess.The characters are unbelievable, unlikable, and uninteresting almost entirely due to the storytelling jumping around so much and leaving out enormous chunks of their lives. Why, with eight hours or so of time, afe so many characters so underdeveloped? Why is so much of the so-called Wasteland in relatively good upkeep after so many years exposed to the elements and no one to maintain any of it?Many sequences are painfully long, and do nothing to enhance the story. Many sequences are introduced and over so quickly one wonders why they even bothered.It's painful to watch.",3
Quite good...,"Right, well this series is definitely one that I had been waiting for. And once it was released, I sat down and binged the entire first season.I have been a huge fan of the ""Fallout"" games and have been playing them ever since the very first game was released. So yeah, there definitely was something riding on this series. And it was a franchise that so very much deserved either a movie or series adaptation. So thumbs up to Amazon Prime for bringing this to the audience.The storyline throughout the first eight episodes that was season 1, was a nicely written one. It definitely felt like a storyline and narrative that you would find and expect in the ""Fallout"" universe. So the writers nailed it on the head, because this was entertaining and enjoyable from start to end.They had a great cast ensemble in the series, with some good leading performers and also good support performers. There were a fair amount of familiar faces on the cast list, and Walton Goggins was so nicely cast for the role of Cooper Howard. Needless to say that it was nice to see Aaron Moten portray Maximus, as that character is a core essential character in the lore of the ""Fallout"" universe.The character gallery in ""Fallout"" was good. Lots of interesting and memorable characters.""Fallout"" definitely had that particular post apocalyptic feel and touch to it that we love from the games. And the attention to detail throughout the eight episodes was phenomenal. I will say that the episodes are well-worth sitting down to watch two times; once for the story, then again for observing all the minute details and things from the games that made it into the series.However, the ""Fallout"" series was not all just great things, because it definitely also had its flaw. The series was missing iconic creatures such as super mutants, deathclaws, radscorpions, molerats, centaurs, etc. And I was also disappointed in not seeing the use of laser and plasma weapons in use throughout the series. Sure, you see laser weapons in the relic store, but would be nice to have seen them in use. These creatures and weapons are a big part of the ""Fallout"" universe.The setting and scenes throughout the series are good. Well, for the most parts. There were scenes that were not having that particular ""Fallout"" nuclear post apocalyptic feel to it. Here I am thinking of all the scenes where the wasteland had green plants growing.The wardrobe and props in the series were good. I really liked the costumes and props that you see throughout the series. And who can't help but cheer when you see the power armor for the first time.Regardless, Amazon Prime did a great job in bringing the game franchise to the screen, and I certainly was wholeheartedly entertained throughout the course of all eight episodes. And if you enjoy the games, then you definitely have to sit down and watch this.My rating of the first season of ""Fallout"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.",8
👍🏼,"Absolutely wicked. Took a few episodes to properly catch my interest but once it kicks in and the plot starts moving I couldn't stop watching.Top performances from everybody but gotta shout out Walton Goggins because he smashed it the most by miles. Great direction, cinematography, special effects, music, etc.Obviously with a show like this you need to use CGI to create certain visuals however for the most part the CGI is actually great and they didn't just use CGI to create everything they needed. You can tell they took the time to use as much practical effects as they needed to create the right aesthetic.Never played the game myself but have a fair few mates I've seen playing it and I've watched plenty of clips online and from what I can see here they have nailed the look and feel of the world too.I also very much appreciated that they didn't ease up on the horror/gore elements and the attention to detail with a lot of things was fantastic.Very excited for season 2 and where they go with it!",9
Beyond Expectation,"I wasn't even that excited for the release of Fallout as I'm not a gamer but I had played Fallout 20+ years ago briefly so I knew the look and feel that would be aimed at for the TV series. Have to be honest, it totally blew me away right from the very opening scene. The sets, the costumes, the props, the makeup - all perfect. The story was gripping enough for me to have watched all of it in two days.The sets are incredible, the effort that went into the small details is immense, at times my eyes were wandering off into the backgrounds lost in the post apocalyptic shanties and characters.I'll definitely be giving it a second view soon, it was totally immersive.",9
We have played all the Fallout games and are digging the show,"We are enjoying it. Watching it has made us want to jump back into Fallout76...which we will probably do after we are done watching. We (husband and I) think they did a really good job with the props and environments. It is neat to see the game come to life. We recommend. Even if you watch it and find you did not like some of it, it is still a good. The actors are decent...some are really good. All-in-all they picked a good cast of people for the roles they are in. We had been following the progress for a long time. It was worth the wait. I will wrap this up by saying we don't think you will be disappointed.",9
Fun show,"I would really like to rate higher than an 8, but my biggest complaint is that they didn't do enough to bring non gamers up to speed. As a fan of the game franchise I really liked the show. My wife who's never played was totally lost.The best solution they could still do is add in a short video, maybe in the animated pip boy style that educates the viewer on the wasteland. Approach it with the concept of someone that knew nothing about the series.For the show itself, I really liked it. The cgi looks pretty good. The acting has been excellent. So far (about halfway through) the writing has been just as good as the games. I would honestly give this a 10/10 IF they could find a way to bring in viewers that know nothing about the franchise without getting them completely confused as to what's going on.",8
Does ALL the Music have to be from Cheesy 40s Radio?,"This takes me out of it sometimes. Maybe some scenes work with it...but music is important, and the really bad choices stand out. Otherwise I'm enjoying it mostly; Michael Rappaport is great in everything & have had a bigger role with fewer F words. He talks like that off camera naturally and it makes him less funny. I do think some familiarity with the game is helpful to enjoy it, like most video game adaptations.: Overall, fans of game movie adaptations who play the game are more into the movies in part just out of excitement that a game they love is actually a movie...gamers have stronger attachments to games than movies in general which makes sense .. avg game these days takes 50 hours to play; made like a movie with talented (real) actors & directors, usually over several months (unless you have a lot of free time) vs a 2-hour movie. I couldn't really get into the game; even had a copy & traded it in without getting very far. I prefer video game adaptations to all the reboots & sequels, which seems to be the only ideas leffA tv series format is much more forgiving. Like Game of Thrones had only 8 episodes & was like the last season, it'd have been panned and cancelled. TV shows can redeem themselves over time. ChatGPTdoesnt write better scripts (as evidenced by HBO's 'Monarch' garbage); good writing is #, and like a few less-rambly reviewers said, it was lazy and nonsensical in several scenes - the sun worshipping orgy, the sex/childbirth scene to name 2. Make the Ghost of Tsushima movie already!",
Film production and its components,"Let's start with the fact that those who were expecting a dark, melancholic drama with complex philosophical explorations in the spirit of ""The Book of Eli"" (2010) or the opposite, full of killer action in the form of ""Doomsday"" (2008), will be disappointed. Fans of art house and ""Six-String Samurai"" (1998) are also unlikely will like the adaptation. Amazon's Fallout, although it has a little bit of everything in it, ultimately remains a predominantly evil satire with elements of fan service, taking the ideological and conceptual basis of the controversial fourth part of the game series.The shelters are safe, but the wasteland is lifeless only at first glance. Monsters come not only in the form of cockroaches, water creatures, but also people. Consumerism of the fifties played a cruel joke on its ideological inspirers. The authors quickly go over the top, paying a lot of attention to small details, references and key elements, some of which, however, will only be understandable to hardcore fans of the genre. A scene later they joke about the fact that the ""Brotherhood of Steel"" uses old technologies to collect technologies, while simultaneously sarcastically noting that there is no practical use for a toaster found in a scorched desert. They immediately switch to the next segment, without really plunging into the context. This approach is reflected in its own way on the main characters:A shelter resident raised on high ideals is forced by circumstances to go to the surface and face harsh reality.A boy who miraculously survived, tormented by moral dilemmas, builds his career in the ""Brotherhood of Steel"".Ghoul cowboy. An ambiguous character with a partially vague past, whose image and behavior, adjusted for local realities, are almost completely copied from the ""Man in Black"" from ""Westworld"" (2016-2022).At first all three will be united by the search for a certain object that can change the fate of the entire surrounding surviving world. Along the way, the main story arc, as usual in an ""RPG with Action elements"", is diluted with several side stories of varying degrees of interest.During flashbacks, when one of the characters indulges in rhetorical reasoning, a third kind character interrupts him with an apt thought - they are all just a product for later consumption, so it's time to forget about art and any meaningful depth in a world ruled by corporations and a joyful consumer culture. What serves as a small plot digression is equally applicable as a verdict on the first season. The film adaptation is not bad in its own way, but at the same time, it's required to understand its specifics and what lies at its core, so as not to expect from it what it is not.",7
good show,"The series is quite good, it perfectly conveys the atmosphere. For those who played the game should like it. I love the post-apocalypse theme. There are not many films on this topic. What disappointed me was the casting for the role of Maximus. Where did they even find this actor? He's pretty uninteresting and uncharismatic, and he's mad throughout the series. The rest of the actors are well chosen. The soundtrack is cool. It's a pity that there are not many episodes, I would like more. Hopefully there will be many seasons and not many years to wait. Nuclear Coca-Cola to all. After the series, you will want to play the game again.",8
"Funny dystopia, poorly named after a video game","I'm the first to admit the humour here is peculiar but it keeps me smiling like a loon, it's entirely fresh out of cruel jokes and it works just fine for me. Jonathan Nolan realised quite a bit and enrolled a favourite actor of David Lynch (the missing father) to jumpstart the action. Let's get weirdo in here !Hardcore Republicans not welcome to say booh !. Seeing what the world would be with you in charge is not your forte. A Ghoul turned smarter in death than alive reminds us how duped you were because he was you. You won't like it.I've quite enjoyed the ride with its touches of ""neo-absurd"" at times (oh spoilers !, their robots aren't Terminators)We all know the origins of the dystopia, in this paralel world that shifted in the early 60s and the Cuban crisis parano in the USA for us, a bit later with the wrong choices for them. The fallout is not that brutal and the rich or obsessed by commies hidden in their vaults have become the opposite of their ancestors. Mostly. In some vaults, anyway, they're all good. I mean stupid GOOD . Downright socialist values in fact in the heroin's shelter.. Which MEANS something is awefully wrong ! For people obsessed with details, why would future people grow corn in the desert ? Now, you get it !A blessed child from Eden, sorry, her vault, steps out and bravely and stupidly discovers the world and the lies she's been fed and struggles to adapt despite well-meaning people from the surface. It's like the cave allegory all over again, her reality is perceived shadows of the outside. Her brother, hardly the adventurer is quite the sleuth on the inside and discovers some disturbing truths too.It's rather entertaining if you get the humour or point of the tale. If not, forget it after the first episode. It may just be some commie Hollywood junk to lure you out of the right path, and it's a bomb; To quote a piece of after disaster humour. It's not nearly as radically critical or provocative as The Boys, for instance. It's a very polite ass-whupping of old clichés all the same.",7
The antithesis of the Last of us,"Let's get one thing straight from the off this is a none gamer review. Sorry to draw comparisons from other similar material, but the last of us was a tour de force of TV storytelling.In comparison Fallout is Simply Hinterland Inferior Trash.Actors are great. Production is very good. Script is appalling, editing appears to fuelled by magic mushrooms, the music department got fried the first day and was replaced by the cast of the jetsons.I was really looking forward to this. But just 3 episodes in it's making me wonder my life choices of being a lifelong SciFi fan. My god it's so poor it hurts.",9
Gold,We need more Ella Purnell she stole the show great series! The time period it's set in the Fall out Universe fits well. The Vibe is fun and the VFX is great. Looking forward to another season already! Prequel series before the events might be interesting but for now we got 8 full episodes and hoping for more seasons in the future. The action/adventure is really good for a video game inspired series one of the best we have seen in a long time. Okie dokie overall I give this series a solid 10/10 Ella is great as Lucy and the rest of the cast fits well with their characters. Solid show on Prime Video!,10
"""Fallout"" hits the tone of the games and builds an immersive universe","I believe that the most important thing this series does in its first season is building the universe the action is set. It was one of the few game adaptations to the big screen or TV show that made me want to play the games again, especially Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, which the show's visuals are based on. The characterization work for the main characters is very thorough, and this is point awarded to Nolan's team, and they also managed to capture and adapt very well this retro-futiristic post-apocalyptic universe that we see in the games. Not much of characters' development is present in the first season but, it is the first season. I really hope that the show can be confirmed for a second season and then we will see more of character development across the board, perhaps even more easter eggs from the games, in this first season I managed to spot a few.",10
Slow burn,"It takes time to develop the story but the last episode of this first season makes it absolutely worth the wait. The effects and graphics are very neatly done too. I began to wonder if the series was based on a video game, because it totally could. Post apocalyptic philosophical thriller. I love how well they've take the time and the whole of the first season to build up the storyline and the characters. I hope the season 2 comes quickly and doesn't disappoint. I strongly recommend the show for everyone in need of something refreshing to watch. It's at times gory but it's not horror (for anyone wanting to know this bit). Can't wait for the next season!",8
Calm down video game junkies,"First off, ignore all the negative reviews about this show. It's mostly fanboys who can't get every single detail of the game into the show. From the acting, writing, and production value, this show is amazing. The tone is just right, the score is great, and they tie a lot of the games elements into the show. Watch at least the first 20 minutes for yourself and see if it's your vibe. This is my first review and had to write something after seeing all the incel trolls. How can you go wrong with Baby Billy as the Ghoul?! Stayed up until 2:00 AM watching the first four episodes and ready to get off work and watch the rest!Cheers!",9
S P E C T A C U L A R,"Fallout {2024} Prime VideoObviously I knew the videogames, but I was never interested in watching gameplays, until now of course. Now I want to go deeper into this universe to find out certain things.There are too many mysteries in the plot and a bizarre policy, if we talk about the shelters, they are very strange, it's like seeing a beehive manipulated for certain missions under lock and key and you must investigate why this or that is done. Chapter 6 has thrown me off with certain themes.An extremely important detail that has made me fall in love, is that they do not only focus on the main character, there are more characters telling their stories individually, showing how their lives were before the changes.Not to mention that there are some very awkward, strange and even funny moments in some occasions, there is a mix of everything.The 50s music, spectacular.The mixed 50s, retro-futuristic, nuclear apocalyptic vibe is incredible. Being an alternate history of earth after World War II. The fact that it's very psychological is very engaging. That they show things from 200 years later, in what the earth would be like in that apocalyptic future, I love it.Politics in this universe is marked by the collapse of traditional government structures and the emergence of new factions, each with their own agenda and worldview. ""Authoritarianism and Totalitarianism, Anarchy, Communism and extreme Nationalism"" In addition to the more common ""Democracy, Republic and much Communist"" The Fallout universe features a variety of dystopian and extreme politics reflecting the catastrophic consequences of war and nuclear destruction on human society.It's an addictive season to learn more, and I would have loved to have more chapters to delve into the past.It's a marvel of a plot, the locations are visually epic.I need the second season immediately.1000/10.",10
"Poor dialogues, unlogical scenes","They keep the style of the games, music but unfortunately they keep Bethesda tradition of poor and uninspiring dialogues.TV series is clearly made for game fans. .There's no much intro into world building, what is the background of each fraction.Some moments looks unrealistic and unlogical even for Fallout retro-futuristic world building. As the other user pointed out, how protection system were so ignorant to the radiationI have played almost every game from this franchise and even they were not so idiotic in some moments. Also I was really happy to see that they gave a role to Ron Perlman, who is a voiceover veteran in this franchise.",6
"Not perfect, but super fun","I'm convinced nobody who left a one-star review watched past the first episode.There are some issues with it for sure, but overall I had a blast! I thought it was true to the spirit of the games (yes I've played them) and also was compelling by itself.There were so many little details to notice, and the characters were actually interesting, each flawed in their own ways, and each of them ending up different than they started.Sometimes the comedy felt forced, some of the lore was off, but almost every time something didn't make sense it was explained later. You just gotta be patient with a story like this, they can't explain everything right away without it feeling like an info dump.Did a really great job of showcasing the universe, while also maintaining an interesting and individual presence in that universe.",9
F bomb of a show,"Saying the f word every 3 words does not make your show edgy and cool. Swearing is not replacement for dialogue. Anyways,I've been a hardcore fan of the games for many many years and played everything from three to 76 and fallout shelter lol. I really really wanted to like that show but considering it was on Prime and the serious failure of other video game to TV adaptions I didn't have much hope and I really wasn't surprised when it was not that great and then happily surprised when it blossomed after episode 3. The show is excessively violent in the first episodes,to the point where it's not enjoyable to watch. It's a lot different playing a fake cartoonish looking video game and knowing that everything that you're doing in it is not real, and video game violence doesn't have the same visual and emotional impact as seeing a real life person's head exploding. That may be the world that they live in but there's no reason to watch it as ""entertainment"", it's just savage.. Not to mention it's an extremely lame excuse for not writing good stories and dialogue and just being like oh we'll just have them explode or be gutted that'll be fun right? Umm no.. Don't get me wrong the props,stages ,CGI and the power armor are great and accurate. Why is the brotherhood only men? Why is the brotherhood only men, it's not in the game. Why is there no trace of vault girl? I like the lead woman as she's so innocent and derpy that it's very comical and I like the ghoul, he's complicated ,he used to be good but he's turned so bitter/evil after living so long , being mangled,losing his family and knowing the truth. There's also the dark humor which I appreciate because that is a large part of fallout ,although it could be more dark funny and less goofy, but at least it's there. Maximus,siiighhhh. It's funny but he's also so annoying. The giant sack they haul around really made me laugh, over encumbered! They also made a mistake with the animals because they aren't bald /mutated but I do like the fact that they used real animals rather than animating them but they aren't accurate. If the second season is like episodes 4-8 then I'll watch it.",6
Brilliant visuals let down by acting and plot development,"I'll start off with saying that I have played the games and love them. What this show does brilliantly is nail the feeling of the games with the music and the visuals which is executed very well. For me, the only other positive in the show is the character and acting of Walton Goggins who is absolutely brilliant as the Ghoul - stand out performance.Where the show really lacks is how much they attempted to pack into 8 episodes. I found myself watching at points and getting quite bored as huge plot lines would be skipped over in a few minutes with no real development. I felt as though apart from Goggins' character, the plot was really lacking.The worst part of the show though was Aaron Moten as Maximus. I don't think I've watched a show with a more dislikable character in a long time. Not only that, I found his acting performance rather lacklustre and unconvincing, I wanted to skip scenes that had him in by the end! The entire plot line with the Brotherhood felt forced.I'm not really sure why this show has such a high rating, I wanted to love it and I'm by no means a purist in regards to the games, but I found that the writing and acting really let it down.",5
"""everyone wants to save the world, we just disagree on how""","Amazon's adaptation of the Fallout video game series delivered at every moment! It wholly embraces the maturity of the games, its story and embodies the spirit of the source rather than trying to make it into something entirely different. A whole lot of fun for both gamers and non-gamers who appreciate good storytelling.High praise to the writers, the actors, the actresses, the directors, the special effects teams, etc. They all brought their A-GAME into making this series like none other and bringing the Fallout world onto the silver screen (computer screen, or where ever it can be watched from). This is a great tribute and shows high respects to the creator of the Fallout titles, Tim Cain.",10
Played every games - loved the tv adaptation,"I agree with most other 1 star reviewers, the wasteland is weak. But note that even in the game the wasteland was weak enough at certain spots to walk normally without any radiation. There are a few scenes that didn't follow any game logic but I believe that was needed for the TV adaptation. Other than that, this is an absolute masterpiece. I've like The Witcher series as much as this series in terms of TV adaptation. Can't wait to see the next season.Note: If you are a hardcore fan of the game series and don't like the TV adaptation, the issue is not with the TV adaptation but how you perceived it. Maybe ease up and change your perspective a little?",9
Next gen TV,"This is a near perfect adaptation of a video game. I thought the last of us was fantastic, but the environment and story of that title was much simpler to address.That show didn't have the complex world and distinct lore that that fallout games have. It feels more of a triumph bringing a title like fallout to the screen because of all the moving parts, the unique 50s aesthetic, introducing different clans and the humour.This show nails it. Its absolutely stunning for fans of the series or for those looking to be introduced to it. I guess this could be the start of a golden age for video game to TV adaptation. Well done prime for backing it and to Bethesda who have been looking for a much needed win.",9
They done did good with Fallout,"I was leery about how this would go.. but after watching it I have to say.. they nailed it on literally every front. It's amazing and must see for fallout fans and even those who have never followed the games just they might miss some of the eastereggs and references. I love the casting choices as well.. again was a little skeptical going in but it worked incredibly well.Getting to see the vault and the environment around the fallout world in live action.. geez.. I don't think I could ask for more. Big thumbs up to Amazon Prime for doing justice to this series and not letting the themes of our day pollute it to much to get messaging across that none of us really want to see. We want to be entertained, and this is entertaining!",10
Hodgepodge script,"This seems like bits and pieces of others sci-fy films. The squeaky clean girl goes roaming in the the post apocalyptic world looking for her abducted dad. Her naivete is unbelievable yet the exposure to the outside causes her to grow. Goggins plays a wild west cowboy ghoul bounty hunter but is he dead or what? This actor really brings star quality in all he does sort of like Jack Nickonson. Despite the usual gory blood baths, with poor character development. The world of a nuclear disaster makes for iinteresting material. Lucy the protagonist blithely just happens to walk into a town and finds trouble she does not understand. At every turn aome one rescues her. A weird choice of 50's technology is featured. Metal armored suits , all kinds of mercenaries , and hidden orders battle to gain supremecy. The soundtrack is horrible takes away from the films ambiance. It gets better it grows on you. Hope for season 2.",8
She's not a girlboss!,"When they anounced that they were going to do the fallout story with a female vault lead I was very concerned that the show would be chalked full of all the same boring and sexist nonsense that has been invading sci-fi, comicbook and video game movies as of late. After watching the first episode I am pleased to say that so far there are no girlbosses, no misandry, no gender whining and no DEI plot armor. The first minute of introduction to the main protagonist definitely gave off a cringey girlboss feminist vibe, but that quickly subsided as we got to know a character that presented herself as genuinely strong and capable yet not flawless and whiney.Overall I like the humor and I like that they were able to introduce a diverse cast and a female lead without falling into the typical Hollywood garbage tropes that usually comes with modern efforts for inclusivity. I look forward to watching the rest of the season!",9
Adds nothing new to the genre,"I understand this is set on a video computer game from the late 90's. I watched the first episode and thought what a load of complete rubbish. But fate intervened. The next day it bucketed of rain so I thought let's endure the next 7 episodes. As it turns out it's a good yarn. Not as bloody as I was led to believe but those bits were obviously from the shoot me up game. The interesting bit for me was to see what transgresses with the vaults. How they came about . In that I think it could have been completed in two episodes. There was a bit of fallow humour. The parallels with the modern MIC was very good. A few messages that may have gone completely over the head of a less mature audience. (As in age). I liked the retro 50's look at times and I'm assuming it's an alternative universe but maybe I'm looking too deep. The ending was too obvious for me and in fact I guessed the premise from episode 1 when the father, Kyle MacLachlan gets kidnapped. However it was better than I suspected. It seems the fanboys of the game are divided on the film series. If like me you've never played the game or ever intend playing the game it'll be worth a watch.",6
War...war never changes.,"As a longtime fan of Fallout, I loved this season! The themes and ideas the series explores with worked really well, it manages to mix a serious story and somewhat dark tones with jokes and funny moments, just like the games do. Salty fans gatekeeping the franchise will give it 1/10 stars, I say ignore both them and me and go watch the series on your own so you won't get influenced. Casting was done really well for both main and secondary characters, my favourites being Thadeus and the dog, good girl. You will notice a lot of attention being put in making the series, as you can tell by looking at the costumes, weapons, enviroments, makeup, a lot of attention to the pip-boy (such as sounds, light, geyger counter, and interface), and let's not forget about food and beverages. From episode 6 to the last seconds of episode 8 I was left speechless continously, and let me tell you, that ending shot with the sun...well we sure know what's coming next. Thanks God I survived long enough to see this, and let's hope I make it to the next season and game. Btw, lots of violence and gore. A lot of creatures come to life thanks to a really good CGI, and altough I was left satisfied I would really like to see a few things next season: a reference of some kind to the aliens, more nuka-cola varietis, a synth, the misterious stranger and a Behemoth. As always, you'll be conflincted on who gains you simpaty because of every character and factions goals and motivations, and even the villain will have good points. This is all from my review, Ad Victoriam!",9
Really nails the games!,"Really nails the games! The costume is spot on, in that it also embraces being over the top in that fallout/rockstar humor. It is cool seeing the games like this and the guy who plays the ghoul he is just a perfect creep and crack up. Im really sorry if he is a great person in real life cause I believe every sleazy thing this guy does.Why the meager rating? The plain Jane boring writing. No chara yer development forever. It seems they chose to make the characters just like atrociously stupid and it's honestly hard to watch. They just do the dumbest things to b le in distress constantly. I don't know why that is necessary considering that they are living in a nuclear wasteland! The story is delivered at a snails pace. We are shoveled endless gore for gores sake. I think that is a mistake. We have had few years of relentlessly realistic gore in high budget works produced by Netflix and all that apple exclusive stuff. I'm tired of it. It's overused and how distracts and detracts from the story. It once sold how extreme something was now it's like tattoos. More than half of people have them on their face and they look like a bunch of sheep following the herd. It's no longer rebellious and edgy! All those girls grew up, didn't leave the trailer, had kids and took them to get these tattoos on their 12th bday lmao. Anyways back to the review because it seems I have not made the dear and all inclusive six hundred American English characters limit! I must be mistaken right?The show is entertaining, especially, if you like the games. I couldn't finish them and this slow delivers on interesting story so slowly after it starts with a bang. Like I thought it was going to go right in and now I'm like a baby along with the girl because she is just so naive that none of these experiences are changing her? And nobody can talk, like a superhero movie all is just fists to drive the bad writing, and then some deus ex machina to further save bad writing. Everybody is very convenient in the path they wonder after the last CGI attack lol.",6
What. A. Letdown.,"I've been a massive fan of the games. Put hundreds and hundreds of hours into them. So I'm familiar with the quirky world and sometimes dark characters and situations. And the games are also violent. But SERIOUSLY. People who find this level of absurd gore and ultraviolence entertaining are disturbed individuals. The makers of this show just want it to be ""The Boys"", but why can't it just be Fallout? You've already got an extremely popular, highly beloved franchise with an incredibly rich world to play in. This show could be incredible. It takes some special people to turn such a sure thing into garbage.",2
Another Gem From Jonathan Nolan,"First of all, I did not expect this show to be this gory and gruesome! I mean, with how brutal the world of this show is, it makes sense for it to be this gory, and PG-13 just wouldn't be as realistic. If it had more gory and bloody scenes, I would think I was watching a body horror instead of post-apocalyptic sci-fi.And I'm not saying that as a negative, exactly the opposite actually. I just didn't expect it to go as far as it did and I'm glad because boy do those scenes look good.So as kind of a Jonathan Nolan fanboy because of Person of Interest and the first season of Westworld, I had no doubt this show would be good. But it actually surpassed even my expectations as to how engaging and well-written this was.I honestly hate that TV shows nowadays only have 8 episodes per season and you have to wait 2 to 3 years till the next one comes out, and you will have already lost all interest or don't remember anything by the time the next season is out. But thankfully, the writers here managed to not only tell a somewhat full story in these 8 episodes but the finale wasn't rushed like every other new show with under 9 episodes.Nearly every episode is an hour, so you'll get enough time to get introduced to the characters, the story, and the world. And they do a phenomenal job with the world-building.From the very first episode, you immediately get thrown into this world and you'll get so immersed in it that you don't want to even get up to go to the bathroom. And yeah, of course, I just binged the whole show for 9 hours straight!The storytelling here is great. The hero's journey and what she goes through is really well done. This isn't one of those situations where the protagonist has plot armor and nothing bad ever happens to her. She actually goes through some sht here and the character development here is great. Lucy from episode 8 is nothing like episode 1 Lucy.The show is also a great adventure show too. The journey of the protagonist(s) throughout the show is great as they get thrown into these post-apocalyptic and weird survival situations that they have to find a way to get out of. And they are all engaging and you just can't wait to immediately watch the next episode when you finish one.The visuals are amazing here. The production value here is top-notch and they build a really believable world that feels lived in with a great variety of characters.This show might not be as deep and philosophical as season 1 of Westworld, but if they keep up the quality writing and don't do another Westworld season 2 to 4, this might end up being even better than that.And sure, the villains' motivation here is a bit cartoonishly evil, but I think it kinda makes sense in the context of this world.The storytelling here is great. Flashbacks are kind of Nolan's forte when it comes to storytelling and Fallout is no exception. They give us more character backstory and world-building through these little flashbacks, and they have the intrigue of Vault 31 that keeps you guessing till the last episode waiting for the revelation. They know how to keep the audience engaged and not reveal everything in episode 1 so there wouldn't be any mystery or intrigue to keep the audience invested in the story.And like I said, the protagonist here is great. She goes through some pretty gruesome stuff in her journey through the wastelands and has moral conflicts about the situations she gets into. That's how a great protagonist should be. A relatable and likable hero that gets changed by her journey and evolves.And yeah, the overall story isn't the most original one or one that you can't predict its clichés or anything. But when it's well done and well incorporated into the context of the story and the world, who cares if there are some clichés here and there? After all, you can't have a story without clichés.And I almost forgot to mention how funny the little bits of comedy they threw in here are. It's not cringey Marvel level of jokes and comedy bits that ruin the tension or the serious scenes, it's actual funny moments that happen in the context of the story that are just well-done and well-placed.So overall, this is one of the best, most well-made, and most engaging recent shows I've watched, or even all the shows in general. And also, not to mention that it is another great adaptation of a video game. I might even like this more than The Last of Us show honestly.So here's hoping the next season doesn't take 3 years to make, and also doesn't end up like the rest of Westworld.",9
Vault Dwellers Rejoice,"Fallout, the television adaptation of the beloved video game franchise, has hit Amazon Prime Video, and it's a triumph. Fans can breathe a sigh of relief - this isn't your typical video game turned TV show. Showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet have crafted a post-apocalyptic world that feels both familiar and fresh.The story follows Ella Purnell's compelling portrayal of Vault dweller Dweller (yes, that's her name), who emerges from her luxurious underground shelter 200 years after a nuclear war. Thrust into the harsh realities of the wasteland, she encounters a world teeming with the series' signature charm - a quirky blend of 1950s Americana and brutal survival.The series excels in world-building. The familiar iconography of the games - from the rusty Pip-Boy interfaces to the menacing Super Mutants - is translated beautifully to the screen. But it's not just about nostalgia. The show expands the Fallout universe, introducing new factions and locations that feel like natural extensions of the lore.High marks go to the show's visual effects. The irradiated wasteland is a character in itself, rendered with a grimy realism that perfectly complements the show's darker moments. Yet, the whimsical touches - a pre-war robot butler navigating a ruined city, a bustling trade caravan bartering with bottle caps - add a layer of humor that keeps the tone balanced.Fallout boasts a stellar cast. Walton Goggins chews the scenery as a charismatic ghoul with a hidden agenda, while Aaron Moten brings gravitas to a weary Wastelander searching for redemption. But it's Purnell who shines brightest. Her wide-eyed innocence as she confronts the harsh realities of the wasteland is both endearing and heartbreaking.The show isn't without its changes from the games. Character builds and branching narratives are understandably absent, but the core themes of hope, resilience, and the cost of civilization remain. The writers have cleverly incorporated winks and nods to the games without alienating newcomers to the franchise.Fallout isn't just a faithful adaptation; it's a fantastic television series in its own right. It boasts a captivating story, a beautifully realized world, and strong performances. Whether you're a seasoned Vault Dweller or a wasteland rookie, Fallout is a must-watch on Amazon Prime Video. Just don't forget to pack your RadAway - things are about to get radioactive.",9
Never been more happy to be wrong about a TV show,"I thought this series would blow so hard but all my fears went away after watching the first episode. I'll try to avoid spoilers the best I can, but the way they tackle the 3 plots that follow one character all with their own motivations I say was done very well. As a show it's very good, I have played a few Fallout games but never finished any of them, now I might. This show doesn't just appeal to fans, obviously the references for fan service is alive and well, but people that don't know the games very well can still enjoy it. If I had to squeak out one complaint is that the depiction of Wasteland looks more like just a plain old desert and not a landscape that underwent a nuclear blast (not a spoiler, the name says it all). It's not that it looks bad, it's just in the games you see the damage that was caused by the blasts even centuries later, in the show it just sand and sometimes trees. It just felt underwhelming to me. Other than that, it's a great show. I came in with very low expectations and was blown away. Definitely recommend.",9
Perfect Adaptation,"I think the people who are complaining about this series just want to complain. The show was an excellent adaptation of the Fallout series. It took the subtle (and not so subtle) humor of the game and translated it perfectly to the small screen. Indeed, I can't think of a single point in the game that I didn't see in the series. There were times I questioned elements in the series and considered whether it would be part of the game if the game wanted a smaller purchasing audience and the answer was always the show got it right. It translated not just the letter of the game, but also the spirit of the game.I've read the reviews about wokist elements in the series and I while I know what they're talking about, I just don't see it to the degree of deserving criticism. First of all, the game was never about a 1950s current Earth. The game is really an alternate world were atomic energy is used in a variety of tools, household appliances, and vehicles. So one really can't advance an idea that this doesn't replicate 1950s world culture. It's not meant to be. With that premise tossed, it leaves the series to establish whatever characters it wants. However, I never saw one single character that wasn't in keeping with the game - not once.Any accusation of the main character being a Mary Sue is a false one I believe. If one makes that accusation than ANY game character is a Mary Sue. Anyone who plays the game knows you start with abilities and increase them as time goes by. We can assume that Lucy is approximately 20-25 years old when episode one begins. This means that she has had some time to develop certain skills as indicated at the very beginning of episode one.I believe the show does a good job of mixing the various Fallout games (1-4 and New Vegas) and I enjoyed that about it. The set design and costumes were absolutely ON POINT. Whoever did the sets and costumes definitely deserves an Emmy. I think the actors did a tremendous job of conveying their characters from a game to a show.The mature parts of the show were also conveyed within the context of the game. The game alludes to many of the things that happened in the show, but never comes right out and shows it. I think the show captured that spirit well.It is going to be hard to find a show to watch after this. I am already wishing there was a second season out and I can't wait for it to appear. I will be rewatching this 1st season again.",10
Fallout is easily the best live action video game to TV adaptation yet!,"I have been a huge video game fan for decades playing Atari, Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft and Playstation consoles. I have enjoyed thousands of videos games for decades and I am a really huge fan of the Fallout series of games from Bethesda. Recently several video games adaptation have appeared on streaming. Twisted Metal on Peacock, Halo on Paramount Plus and of course The Last of Us on Max which I found to be both boring and pointless and I really hated the second game in the series. When it comes to Fallout, I was highly skeptical as were millions of fans of the game. However to my surprise it is definitely the best live action video game to television adaption yet, with a plot that actually makes since and superb acting. After the fiasco that was Rings of Power that made me want to cancel my prime subscription they redeem themselves with the awesome Reacher series and now Fallout my favorite live action video game show to date. Jonathan Nolan , (brother of Oscar winner Christopher,) of Westwood fame really enjoys playing the games and it shows in every detail including hundreds of Easter eggs within the game series! Bravo Prime you did a great job with Fallout!!",9
Beautiful,"These people who are saying the pacing is too slow probably sit on tiktok all day watching brainrot. I am 13 and sat through every episode, excited for the next. This is a great adaptation, and all these fallout superfans need to stop nitpicking on the tiny details, like how ghoulification works. Who cares! Its a great show that stays mostly true to lore. It has a compelling storyline and great visuals. And to all of you who say ""oh but the show relies on CGI too much."" How about you go make a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland using practical effects. Don't listen too the one star reviews, they just don't know a good TV show if it slapped them in the face.",10
like it so far,"Woudl've given it a higher score but really can't stand the annoying music and slow motion, why can't they just fight without the stupid music and slow motion ? Other than those, it's a pretty enjoyable series so far.

It Just Works,"This show ROCKS. I cannot believe it turned out this good. I love the games and felt like it would be tough to adapt because of the tone and outrageous aspects of the world. But to quote the Todd, ""it just works."" The show nails everything from vibe, to music, to costume and set design. It is clearly high budget and there are tons of deep cut game references for the fans. All the characters are like able. The writing is funny! Each plot line is interesting and they intertwine just the right amount.One of the best video game adaptations ever if not the best. Made me immediately go back to the games! WATCH THIS SHOW.",10
War never Changes.,"Fallout is a very beloved series amongst Gamers with Its extensive world-building and Lore. The variety of factions and people that populate Its Wastelands to its themes of Corporatism and political ambition and its Morality & Ethics of Human Society. It's ripe for the picking stories to be told. All and all Fallout does well in not only respecting its source material but also serving as an entry point for newcomers without holding your hand. Putting you in the perspective of its main character starting with Lucy the vault dweller. Given her isolated upbringing and what she has been told her whole life. She's reckless, Naive, and Gullible. She has to adapt and learn from the people she comes across. And the choices she has to make and live with. The other two main characters. The Ghoul who is my favorite just this complete Badass bounty hunter and Cold-hearted man. You get to see his past pre-war and what's driving him. Maximus this brotherhood Squire who goes rogue in ways makes questionable choices in brotherhood. All three of their stories are tied to this Scientist. Also, this sub-plot Mystery Centered around Vault-tec. It feels Balanced out and paced the journey. You don't need to know everything about the Enclave, Brotherhood, or NCR. Prop also has to be given to the designers. I felt that they would have just done the bare minimum. The only well-made would've been the power armor. No, they did put effort into capturing the setting and atmosphere of the games. Morbid dark and violent. The Vaults Corps. Things like the Pip-Boy display and how it functions. The Action Lots of Blood and the use perfect use of Slo-mo Call back to V. A. T. S. The choice of Music how they had original Music, but also took from the Game Soundtrack and the way it's used adds to the charm. Overall, I enjoyed it, and for another season if it stays this route.",6
Seems like a really bad fan fic,"I feel like the show would've been 10x better if they'd removed the Lucy storyline and just followed the Ghoul. Her story added nothing and was just plain irritating. It was filled with plot holes, too.The show missed the entire vibe of Fallout and changed lore because they wanted to fit things neatly into their story. Everything felt forced, like they needed to cram as much in as possible.If you aren't a Fallout fan, maybe you'd like it? But if you are a fan, this just doesn't work. It felt like a really bad fan fic. I'm disappointed; I was really hoping that there would be a whole series we could enjoy in between games. I don't think I could make it through another episode.The show should've chosen a direction and a story and stuck with it instead of being all over the place. Just a mess.",2
Outstanding,"As someone that has played the games, I loved the first season. I think that it stayed very true to the games Even the gore was just enough but not over the top. One of my favorite lines is when they poke fun at how side quest always distract you from the main story line of the games, and indeed, that is what happens in the TV series as well. Also it downplays sex to a meaningless sidebar that the characters have, which mimics the flirt options in Fallout 4 and makes for similarly awkward and funny dialogues. There is only two things that I can criticize but they are so minute that they are not worth typing out. I can't wait to see if Season 2 is just as good.",10
Made by a true fan. Excellent,First if all it looks absolutely perfect. It's so accurate to the games and the characters are as surreal as the games. The storyline although not in line with any of the game plots is brilliantly conceived and suits the fallout universe. I can't wait for the next season to see what it brings. The thing I love about the series is the way that they utilise the choices made by each of the characters. Just like in the game there are decisions made that go against the obvious storyline and take the characters in an unusual but still viable direction. The Ghoul played by Walton Goggins is a great addition. And his back story has been really good. Hoping we find out more as the story progressess. Overall. Its up there with the best Game based conversions. But on its own stands up as a modern and fresh series that delivers on multiple fronts. Funny. Full of suspense. Multi faceted plot lines. Loved it.,9
"Fallout fan here, watch it, it is good!","I had doubts, I tried to avoid hype. I expected something mild, more suitable for soft audience. I am delighted that the series is nothing like that, it is fallout in every way. I don't care about noticing minor errors, hell, this is good. It has atmosphere, it is dark, it has sense of humor, gore, whatever you would expect from a good Fallout game.Story. It is generally good, I would say typical Bethesda. Not the strongest point, but well written.Why not 10/10?I missed the even deeper darkness of the first two games. It wasn't particularly cruel. Could go deeper.Could use somewhat slower pace, more episodes, more focus on individual characters, they could have been deeper.Missing NCR flaws.VaultTec storyline. I don't want to spoiler here, if you are a fan, you will understand what I do refer here.Still, 8/10 is perfectly earned. If you are Fallout fan, don't miss it.",8
Great show! Can't wait for season two!!,Great writing. Great actors. Overall amazing. Really enjoyed it as a date night show with the mans. Absolutely cannot wait for season two!! We are on the edge of our seats!Lucy is a very compelling character. All the characters are flawed yet have redeeming qualities. It was great to watch their stories unfold! Ending made perfect sense yet wasn't guessable! Loved how they set it up.I genuinely enjoyed every character. One of the first shows were I enjoyed the flashbacks. Most tv shows I just roll my eyes and get through them. This time I was deeply invested!Counting down the days till season 2!,10
Amazing show !,"I love this show and the actors I am a big fan of this show not only because I love the video game but also because there isn't much video game movies that have done it right . Also, Walton Goggins a.k.a Shane is one of my favorite actors and this is a role he absolutely owned . I hope the directors go on to create more shows like these maybe bioshock or red dead . The set is also great and the costumes . The storyline is also very real and ties in to reality . I'm not done yet with the show but I don't even want it to end and hope for many more seasons maybe spin offs . And the acting from all the actors was great .",10
Good story telling and characters that grow,"I've never played the Fallout games, but I've really enjoyed the show so far. One of the big reasons for this is the characters. They are well written, with flaws and motivations that make sense for who they are and they fit into the world they inhabit. Lucy (the main character) is an excellent example of a great ""hero with a heart who has a lot of flaws to overcome on her journey"" and I am grateful the writers are actually letting a female character make mistakes and grow. It's a refreshing change from the boring characters being churned out by the big studios (especially Disney's Star Wars).",10
"It could've went either way, it still can","We all prepared for the worst and it didn't come.Fallout TV show was kinda good.They've nailed the aestethic, went a bit overboard with the music and had interesting characters. They respected the games pretty much to a letter.Walton Goggins is great, as always, but I think Ella Purnell was the best one here. While the characters were interesting, I wished they were a bit ""more"" of everything.B plot inside the Vault 33 is also solid but they did took their sweet damn time revealing it. Main plot is interesting and in tune with the games.Biggest flaw is, however, that they just could not decide if this was a comedy or a serious drama, then blending it both in a way that made it neither. Is it funny? Yeah, but kinda not really. Is it very serious? Yeah, it tries to be but it's just not working sometimes.It should have been a straight up comedy with serious elements here and there. But, nothing that can't be fixed in Season 2.However, I'm pretty sure Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy duo as producers are mostly responsible for tone consistency problems. Like their previous potential TV hits - Westworld and Peripheral, this can be driven into the ground like those shows as well. Most notably - Westworld, that started great and it went nowhere in the worst ways imaginable to the point that most people that stuck to the cancellation probably hate watched it.Hope they see the error of their ways or the big wigs above decide to can them and get some new people, better suited for the job.You should check this out.",7
Faithful to the video game,"As an avid Fallout fan since the release of the first game in 1998, I must say that I was quite impressed by the first episode (my review might change as I get deeper into the episodes).Apart from The Last of Us and Twisted Metal (adapted from Video games), I've been rather disappointed by the recent SF novel adaptations (Silo, Beacon 23, 3 bodies problem), and I was a bit afraid that the tone and the atmosphere weren't truthful to the video games.Thankfully, the first episode was rather very impressive, the music is exactly what you could expect, and the different characters' arcs are promising.If you have never heard of Fallout before, you will miss a lot of easter eggs and references, as well as background and lore (what are ghouls, mutants, why are people living in Vaults etc...), but the overall quality and story might still be appealing to you.I just regret that we didn't get to see a mutant rat and a radscorpion, as a direct reference to the 1st Fallout introduction (but we might see them later).",9
Arguably Good Writing From Trash Hollywood In Recent Years,"Everything ties together so nicely of present and past.The characters are built just nicely, really good choice of songs,the juxtaposition of old songs with future world was humourous and ironic.Excessive Capitalism is explored till the point of god like decisions being taken.There was Instances of bad cgi but this was over taken by the good designs of the gulper,giant roaches,and the beautiful western accent of the ghoul.An energy and resources control is still being waged by various factions vying for power.The show was beautiful executed though we would love if more creaturess were shown,more of those giant machine suits being used and explanation for what powers them or where those ospreys wer getting their fuel from.Each episode was an hour long, it's obvious lots of thought went to it,this is Loki style writing and we are all here for it.",7
Meh...,"The first episode was a super ultra violent clockwork orange mess. After that it tones down a little bit and get barely watchable. However, people who love the video games, especially those who go back to Fallout 1, probably won't agree with the storyline of this.Citizens of Vault 33 are annoyingly California liberal. You would want to kill them if you were stuck underground with them. They are apologetic idiots concerned with stupid leftist garbage. The mutants in Vault 7 are preferable to the liberals even though they are doing evil experiments. At least they aren't liberal trash with mush for brains.One of the main characters (the cowboy actor who turns ghoul) starts out totally pro-American, get's talked into some communist garbage by a communist acting buddy.The whole storyline is one giant 'Capitalism is evil', 'communism is good' propaganda line of complete BS. So, that pretty much ruins the series altogether. There was no need to go down this stupid and ridiculous road. Val-tec has to destroy the world since it made the vaults and blah blah blah. Evil corporate greed destroys the world blah blah blah. And lots of empathy for the Hollywood commie crowd because of course in this story they were correct.... blah blah blah.So, the eye candy is interesting. A lot of the dialog is smut of garbage and not interesting and sometimes pointless. Story is kind of garbage really. So, the whole thing is Meh... so typical of something Hollywood (the real one in real life, not the story one) would produce and put out there. Hollywood, these days, has to ruin everything it touches includes stellar video game franchises.Watch for the eye candy if you want but it will destroy your love for the game franchise. This show makes me hate the vault dwellers.",3
Actually Good,"They did a good job. I was expecting this to be sub-par for a number of reasons- Obviously, tv spin offs of video games are historically mediocre at best up until recent years. I'm also not typically a big fan of the shows on Prime Video so that made me a bit skeptical.I'm not going to go on about the games because this will turn into an essay about why I love them so much instead of a review of the show, but I would like to compare some things between the two.One of the things I have somewhat mixed feelings about is the tone of the show. The tone is a bit different for each of the games- Fallout 1 and 2 (and New Vegas) are brutal and dark and absurd. And lonely. But hilarious too. Fallout 4 felt more hopeful and colorful (for better or worse). The tone of the show feels closest to Fallout 4. The show needed to be brutal and it needed to have the right kind of humor. I think it almost nails it, but I personally believe I would have preferred the bleaker tone of the original games.The other thing I had mixed feelings about was the ghouls and the way they became feral. It felt too much like they were humans becoming zombies- like they were trying to fight off a virus and they're sort of being jolted in and out of control of themselves, until they're ulimately feral. To me, it makes more sense for ghouls to slowly transition into being feral where their cognition declines over time. I realize this is kind of a nitpicky criticism.I like the characters too. I was expecting them to be one dimensional and on the nose, but they're actually interesting and have some depth to them.It's a good show. It's not my favorite show of all time. But it's a good spin off of my favorite video game series of all time, and I'm happy with it.",9
Griping,"I tried to play fallout 4 back in the day but could never get to grips with game. This didn't stop me loving the concept. Low and behold Amazon makes a tv show about the game Fallout. I love post apocalyptic stuff and this ticks every box.It's got that 1950's vibe with a touch of futuristic dreams, that the era so yearned for.The plot is sound and the characters are well thought out with twists as the show continues.You might recognise a voice of one of the robots it took me a while to realise who it is but once you know the penny will drop!Over all this is the perfect way to spend an evening. It's 100% better than the boring walking dead!",10
Definitely my favorite Videogame adaptation so far.,"As a fan of the Fallout series I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this show is. The story is very compelling especially if you like the Fallout lore, which I do immensely. It perfectly captures the tone and setting from the game series, and has tons of great callbacks and references, using its source material exceptionally well. The characters were all incredibly well written and I legitimately like the entire main cast. I am beyond happy that this show turned out to be as good as it is, especially for a videogame adaptation. I can't wait for the next season, and I only hope the quality remains just as good as this first season. This show is definitely worth watching even if you aren't familiar with the Fallout games and I highly recommend it.",9
Ella Purcell makes the show,"Loved everything about it! Ella Purnell is brilliant and carries the show. Her fellow cast supports her in the amazing performance that she gives as they too feed off of her energy and give an amazing view into this enthralling story. I couldn't wait for her scenes, as Lucy made every moment a life changing step in her journey. Great story. Captivated at the very beginning. The characters instantly draw you in making the series that much more intense. I've never played the video game (I'm 49) but I see the appeal and would love to try and play. I love when Lucy keeps getting called Goosey. Such a great comedic relief to the intensity of the action packed scenes. I've already recommended to all my friends, who replied that they too had started watching the incredible new series. I can't wait to see what happens next.",8
They nailed it!,"I played fallout a couple years ago. At that time the game had a unique atmosphere which you cannot find anywhere.The tv show has it too! It's freakin hard to nail it, but they managed.Every little detail is polished to perfection. We science fiction fans need more shows like this.The storyline is simple, but not too plain.The character development is visible and grounded. I don't tend to overpraise, or even rate here, but this show deserves this minimum.As several people praised before me, the heroine is weak and naive. I'm tired of seeing OP characters everywhere. This makes it much more human and believable.",10
Good first season,"Did it nailed the camera and aesthetics of the Fallout?Yes.Does it has flaws ?Yes.Are the cast good?Yes , they are awesome, every single one.Is it too short to have hundred hours genre/games cramped into 8 hours of footage?Yes, the universe is massive and the games have hundred of hours worth of material.Does it follow the games?Just aesthetics and timeline, takes place years after the events of Fallout 4.Is it a good package that introduced fans and newcomers of the world?Yes , it does not disappoint.I enjoyed the first season - I'm not an avid fan I played on occasions 3, New Vegas and 4- I did not replayed the games for hundred of hours with over 100 mods each.Bring on Season 2 with the New Vegas story and see how things with a bigger budget, maybe with more episodes ( I hope) and with the experience of S1 will be one of the best new shows of the year.",9
Review from someone who's never played the game.,"Yes, I haven't played the game. I've heard of it, but I went into this completely blind. I had no background context and most definitely did not get any jabs to the game, but I did enjoy it. I found it was really well-paced, it didn't rush into anything and allowed me to understand the plot. Which I would've gotten almost instantly if I knew the lore of the game. I thought the costume design was great, and so was the set design. However, I found the dialogue between Lucy and Max extremely awkward and their romance was tedious, I don't think they had much of a spark at all. KYLE MACLACHLAN IS BAE!",7
Great series - childish gamers need to get over themselves!,"As a gamer, I find it pretty embarrassing looking at some of the 1 or 2 star reviews that seem based on idealised visions of a game from 27 years ago. It's not 1997, folks, you can step out of Vault 13 and look at the world around you and see how it has evolved.Placing the games to one side, this is a highly enjoyable series. The main cast members are great in their respective roles - I particularly enjoyed Walton Goggins but all three inhabit their characters well. The large array of side characters also provide plenty of interest and there's some really tight performances throughout the 8 episodes.The visual effects range from stellar to just acceptable. This is a tv programme though and not a $400m, 2-hour, blockbuster, movie so it may be advantageous to set your expectations accordingly.I'll keep my fingers crossed that this is received well by the general viewership and that we can see this pushing into further seasons - it'd be a real shame if the opinions of some review-bombing or gatekeeping gamers affected the future of this satisfying show.",8
Ok okey,"Not as expected..
Watched 4 episode and yet non of them makes you to watch next.. ( you can leave easily on any point of the story)
story and character didn't grab you.No thrill or excitement..
If you don't have any choice for time pass then you can go for it.I was really waiting for this but it is really disappointing..So many things doesn't sense at all.. but we can accept that because it's made from video game..No thrill or excitement..

The Game is Better ... So it Everything Else,"How this piece of trash has garnered as many high reviews, completely mystifies me. This series has absolutely nothing going for. I would give it a negative rating if I could.As far as I'm able to perceive, there is no writing talent on display. The plot is a long, tedious, predictable, patchwork of cliches, with absolutely zero new or compelling. The writers appear to have attempted to substitute weirdness here and there to compensate for their lack of ideas and skill, and in so doing, only create boredom.There are several clumsily intertwined subplots, which all ""resolve"" in thuds in the last episode. No plot twists a moderately intelligent view couldn't predict from the first quarter of episode 1. There is no compelling character development. But what's even more astonishing and appalling, is that over the course of 8 full length episodes, the writers fail to establish even one convincing personal relationship.There is gratuitous gore and an abundance of stylized fight scenes, that are as pointless and unimaginative as they are boring to sit through.If I may indulge a speculation, the writing in this series reminds me of a period a few decades ago, when the US movie industry reached a low point and many writers and actors were struggling with drug addiction and alcoholism. It became something of a joke when yet another Hollywood figure checked into the Betty Ford center for ""exhaustion"" and a number of them died very young. In those days, people writing really weird, incompetent, scripts while they were high became a common problem. Is something like that happening again? I watch so many truly weird movies these days that have inexplicably little going for them, especially given the substantial budgets behind them.Even Ella Purnell's grace and beauty is wasted, as she's put opposite the decidedly dull Aaron Moten, who's character is weaselly and emasculated and portrayed with as much charm and charisma as cold molasses leaking from a rusty can. If there was any chemstry between these two, it must have ended up on the editing room floor. It would have made a difference if he could at least occasionally make a facial expression. Perhaps one might make a study of characters like Han Solo, whose less than perfect character, did not prevent him from having charm, masculinity, or attractiveness.Then, there's the music. Both the relentless period music and the abysmal score, detracted from this film to the point where I think I'd rather have watched a remix with all music removed. There's a weird retro aspect to this movie that they are catering to, but, really, how much 1940's music and Johnny Cash do they think a contemporary viewer has the patience for?",1
Great Show! Top 7 easy,"I'm a lifelong Bethesda Gamer and let me tell you, the amount of time, and money spent on this show is top notch. The costumes to the set design, looks just like the game and more. There's nothing can say that this show needs, it covers every aspect. Makes me want to go play Fallout again.Humors, gore, drama, and great acting from all sides. Beautiful scenery and great story line I was hooked from beginning to end. I actually watched them all in one day. Not a dull moment.If you have never played the video game or video games at all for that matter, it won't make a difference. A lot of action and hilarity ensue.",10
Yes,"One of the best video game adaptations I have ever seen. I played the game for hour and hours and hours. Seeing it come to life, seeing the characters come to life, was wonderful. It was really cool to see all these details from the games appear in the show. Seeing the backstories of the characters. I would watch 100 episodes of this.I cannot praise this show enough!Blast from the Past meets Walking Dead meets Billy the Kid.The prosthetics are really great. The shooting locations added to the 1950's-60's vibes. As did the wardrobe.If you are a fan of the games I definitely recommend checking this show out!",9
GOAT List Potential.,"Ya like straight up don't listen to the haters this show has potential to be one of the best potential series of all time. Having the story be based on the world of fallout and not any specific game only works if quality characters and plot are present. This show is that much brilliant in more. The soundtrack and is elite and you will get goosebumps watching so many different moments. Honestly it gives severance and breaking bad vibes, no idea why. Must watch and when all is said and done may very well be in the hall of fame - all time best list. The acting is at one of the highest levels I have ever seen watch a television show or movie.",10
Patrolling the mojave almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter,"This will become the best tv show in history 👏
As long as they do a big Mt episode or sierra madre episode. Patrolling the mojave almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter, there's so many amazing and bizarre character they can opt for hundreds of paths to chose from, the games are great and were originally influenced by 1970/80s novels and movies so a TV adaptation will and has thus far worked very well, I have always been hopeful for a tv show of my favourite game series and its a delight to see it come true in my life time, the cast are perfect 👌 the script is perfect 👌 the timing is perfect 👌 I can not wait to see what season 2 has to offer, happy trails kiddos.",10
We want moree <3,"This series is truly remarkable, offering an immersive experience filled with captivating plots and events that keep you engaged throughout. It's like stepping into a dynamic world where every moment feels alive. The jazz music, particularly the main theme, adds another layer of charm and atmosphere to the storytelling. Even if you're not familiar with the Fallout game franchise, I highly recommend giving this series a watch. Its blend of compelling narrative and memorable soundtrack ensures an unforgettable viewing experience.Hopefully the producers are working on a new season, because we want more.",10
Spot on,"I had really low expectations but was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I have no complaints couldn't have been done better, both true to lore and a genuine intriguing show for those not familiar with the games. 10/10.The costume, scenery, music everything is well thought out. The acting is also very top notch they managed to snag the dark humor aspect as well. So glad that the power armor part isn't pure cgi really looks great, same with ghouls, yuan Gao and scenery. Hope this sets a trend for more great adaptations!I don't want to set the world on fire baby, I just want to start a flame in your heart!",10
The future of Earth,This series is based on the game of the same name. I didn't play the game and the series was exciting and fun for me. The series shows the future when the world has been destroyed due to nuclear wars and the majority of its population has been destroyed and only a part of the earth's population who were previously in special shelters have been saved. The story starts with a certain excitement and this excitement continues throughout the story. The characterization of the main actors is done well. The struggle between the survivors for survival is well and excitingly shown. The future of the earth with these people will be very terrible.,7
Fantastic adaptation,"This show is up there with The Last of Us and Arcane as proof that video games CAN be adapted to TV shows successfully, as long as you treat the source material with respect.I don't know the games well enough to comment on the small details, but from what I do know of them, Jonathan Nolan and co have definitely got the world right. It feels very authentic to the games, capturing the awe every player feels on exiting the vault for the first time, on seeing the destruction of the wider world around the vault, on discovering the various settlements, on encountering the various weirdos around the Wasteland...taking the route of creating a wholly new story within the established world of Fallout was definitely the best creative decision they made here.The cast are incredible, too. From relative unknowns (to me, at least) like Aaron Moten (Maximus) and Moisés Arias (Norm MacLean), to better-knowns (to me, again) like Zach Cherry (Woody), Leslie Uggams (Betty), Sarita Choudhury (Moldaver), and Ella Purnell (Lucy MacLean), all the way up to the iconic Kyle MacLachlan (Hank MacLean) and Walton Goggins (The Ghoul), everyone is impeccably cast and each plays their role perfectly.The story itself is REALLY good, with the three distinct journeys - Lucy's, The Ghoul's, and Maximus' - being woven together brilliantly at times while also getting enough room to breathe and build on their own. I can't wait to see what this series has planned for the future. I only wish it was a couple of episodes longer.",8
You warmed up a classic fan's heart,"First of all, let me tell you that I'm a BIG fan of the classic Fallouts. It all started with the Fallout 1 Demo back in 1997. Now, I wasn't particularly happy with how the franchise was handled after Fallout 2 and thought I'd never see the world that I ""felt"" back then. Until this TV show, that is. I am blown away by the attention to detail, the love that went into production, the acting, the music, the dark humor, the horror of a post-nuclear world. Bravo to the whole team; I am sure the forefathers of Fallout and many older fans are applauding you right now. I am currently on episode 5 but am excited to see where the follow-up episodes and further seasons take us.",
"Attention to detail, yet not exactly Fallout","Being a huge Fallout fan, and having played all games since Fallout 2, I was a bit skeptical. But when I started watching the series, the attention to detail quickly captivated my curiosity. ""Maybe they really paid tribute to the games?"".And yes, they did in my opinion. However, there seems to be a main focus point on sex and breeding, which in itself is fine, but was never mainly important in the games. Also, the fact that the first season is focused on bringing a head somewhere, doesn't give me a 'Fallout' vibe. It was never a main quest in any of the games or side quests that I played, and combined with the first point I made about sex playing a major role it doesn't feel like a true Fallout adaptation.Like I said, the attention to detail is amazing. As well as the fact that most Vaults were mainly used for experimentation. I also love the characters/actors, but somehow I'm still not sold. Even for Fallout, I think the first season is too much over the top and it needs some adjusting.Also, fusion cores don't last forever, which they make it seem like in the series. And 'civil' ghouls never needed a medicine in the games, they either became feral or stayed civil after the Great War.",7
Maybe the most overrated series ever,"Except the effects, this series is pure garbage. Storytelling, action, characters, everything is faulty and amateurish.I really have never seen something so badly made, it's a sort of slapstick farce enhanced by technology.Nothing links with anything, there is a obscure, barely discernable plot going on, the characters have no real motivations, the action flow is fractured and twisted without reason, in fact one could analyze this piece of crap on how not to assemble a drama of any kind.Now it has a 8.6 IMDB rating. This is atrocious.Felt the need to log in here to write this even though I don't do reviews here.Watch it on your own cost, if you assign zero value to your personal time.",2
One of the best Fallout Adaptations,"Other than maybe the fan series Nuka Break this is one of the best Fallout adaptations. Would love to give this series a full 10/10 but it falls short explaining why this chapter of the Brotherhood is so different from the ones we know (although Season 2 can easily remedy this) and why the ghouls appear so nearly human. The series gives fans a lot to enjoy with incredible set designs and great casting as well as making itself easy for non-fans to step into the world. The decision to make the three protagonists represent the levels of lore knowledge of viewers was a nice touch giving everyone at least one character to relate with and helps those with or without familiarity to source material, mainly the games, hop in.",9
Best video game adaptation,"It's Fallout's jokes, rather than its plot, that make it one of the most faithful - and best - video game adaptations. The show focuses on Lucy MacLean , a young woman who grew up in an underground bunker, Vault 33, which sheltered her ancestors from nuclear war. When her father goes missing, she leaves the safety of the bunker to rescue him. The tone, the visuals, the meticulous attention to the detail of the game world is a far cry from some other adaptations-which-will-not-be-named that try to completely blaze their own path. This is extraordinarily faithful to the games while not being a straight adaptation of any one game in particular, even if it shares at least one central baseline: A vault dweller must head to the surface and find their father.",10
Blueprint for making video game TV show,"This show should be a blueprint of how to make video game tv shows work. This is how new non-gaming audience is engaged to a show. I had never played the game but after watching the show I want to.Purnell is amazing as vaultie, Goggins as Ghoul delivers absolute gold as always. I have been a fan of his ever since I saw Justified. Maximus actor was decent-ish and not great as his acting felt kinda missing something.The script for most part was decent with good emotional and comedic bits. Dialogues are good for most of the show. CGI looked choppy sometimes but it is not that bad. Over all a good show and a must watch.Well done all!",9
Good reason,"I'm a fallout fan, albeit not hardcore. I played Fallout 3, 4 and New Vegas (only partially for New Vegas).I'm not however a die hard fan, knowing the exact timelines. There was someone complaining about continuity for example, as ""caps"" were no longer the currency when the series happen.. But really who cares.Aesthetically, game borrows heavily from Fallout 4, with a bit of overexposed visuals, but with dark and witty humor, and gruesome deaths. That is the core essence of Fallout, and that part is nailed 100%.The story is decent, and there no major plotholes, with the occasional twist. The interesting aspect is, there are no real baddies, and just people trying to survive, so at many points in the series you can relate to different characters. This in my opinion makes for good television.The story conclusion with the ""major"" reveal was a slight letdown, and I wish they would've went a more bold route, but my guess is the writers tried to appeal a broader audience and get more people hooked up.Tldr, series captures the fallout element, and stands on its own as smart television, with good twists, good character development & presentation and some moral questions here and there for the audience. Good witty (and dark humor), fallout style.The ending could've been a bit better, but it was a satisfying conclusion to the season. Bonus points for finishing the story, and not ending the season in a cliffhanger.",9
Everything to keep fans new and old happy,"As a life long Fallout fan, this series ticks every box available. The tone, storyline, setting etc. Makes you feel part of the video game, but for those who haven't been lucky enough to play the games, there's plenty on offer to cater for all audiences.The constant yet subtle nods to the game series makes me smile, the fantastic level humour makes me laugh out LOUD and all the gory action and Storyline is the perfect tool to stitch the story together in a way that stays true to the game, but by providing a fresh new story at the same time.The characters are well cast, which makes each scene perfection, the action is gory but it adds to the overall tone (which I love) - the storyline is well written and will make
You want to binge the whole series (I have 2 episodes left at time of writing)",9
Fallout(2024-),"I'm a giant fan of fallout video RPG game ,I've logged hundreds hours into Fallout 3 game and just absolutely dig the world Bethesda has created. Today we crave more and more of a good show, so much so that our culture defines this obsession as ""binging"", a term often used to describe a multi-day drug bender that now reflects the quality of a good show.Well, this isn't just good, it's binge worthy and then some.It's what myself and every other Fallout player have dreamed of; a completely original story set in the Fallout universe, and we get to start with the Bloody Mess perk.This is a dark, violent and emotional series with enough humor and romance to even it all out, making sure that every element of good storytelling is there, and that it all takes place in both the Wasteland and the Vault. This is a hard-R rated series with gore, cursing, sex, nudity, the whole lot. But not in a way that feels exploitative for its own sake just... In a future, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles brought about by nuclear decimation, citizens must live in underground bunkers to protect themselves from radiation, mutants and bandits.Ella Purnell in Fallout (2024)All the people living in these underground communities are forced to come up and live. Ella Purcell stars as Lucy, one of the people who's never been above ground before and wasn't prepared for the lawless society it has become. One of the most underrated actress I seen in some time she has great comedic timing , charm ....and grit !!Looking forward to what's to come and so far it's good. I highly recommend it, Fallout fan or not!!!They nailed the vibe spot on and the story and characters are well cast. 8/10.",
Well done and enjoyable but still...,"After watching the first season, I can say it was well-done, of high quality and enjoyable enough.Perhaps I was not the target audience, or perhaps everything was too foreshadowed such that I dont recall being surprised by anything. Or perhaps it was the times the show seemed to break its own rules.. I am not sure, but I dont feel as impressed as I should be which is weird.I will still check out season 2, and did enjoy it. The quality is certainly worthy of the 8.7 score it currently has, but ... it just feels like something was missing. Its hard to say, but I really only enjoyed it like a 6 or 7 out of 10..still check it out, people seem to love it.",7
Almost perfect !!! Probably the best tv show adaptation of a game,"Ever since the show was announced I was waiting for it , I love Bethesda games, grew up playing Skyrim but never tried out a fallout , but man this show was amazing, from the start till the end tying all the plot and giving each and every character a purpose, it's a trio linear story which gets tied to each other with several twists and turns , GHOUL is the best , Lucy is amazing the actor who played Lucy perfectly executed the role. Lucy's reaction to several surface stuff which she's seeing for the first time gets her soo surprised yet she's eager to find her dad without giving up is great , and the development of a regular apprentice soldier to a sword , 2nd in command to a literal legion army a faction called brotherhood of steel , the twists and turns leading to a great finale which shows both the past and the present before the bomb dropped, fallout has done it , it could have had more content even tho it was already entertaining it just made me want more of that dystopian world , I started playing the games enjoying every bit waiting for a second season
Cheers.",8
"It's not bad, but could be better.","The sets and the vibe do a great job at capturing the essence of Fallout. The ghoul and Norm are carrying the show on their back in my opinion. The show has some great scenes. But there is room for improvement with writing, directing, acting and actor choices.A major gripe of mine is the pacing in many scenes. For example (one of many), the scene in episode eight between Lucy and her dad where he is asking her to go home with him, lasted way too long. We get it, she's devastated and isn't sure what to do. But the scene didn't need to be dragged out to get that point across. These awkwardly long scenes can cost the dramatic effect they are trying to achieve. Also timing between dialog and characters were bungled from time to time. For instance; all of Thaddeus's dialog felt awkward and it seemed as if the actor hasn't performed a day in his life. It was immersion breaking.Another immersion breaking constant was Aaron Moten (Maximus). This main character is given the least amount of backstory in this season and his character comes off childish and inept, in turn his scenes with Lucy and other character's are off putting. As if the actor is deciding scene to scene how he's going to play his character and it comes across as lacking consistency. I was unable to tell if Aaron is just a bad actor or the show needs better directors.Fight scenes were clunky at times, The injected humor in scenes didn't come across the way I think the show intended. But I can let that slide.However, overall I feel they did a good job and would like to see where they go in Season 2.",7
"A for aesthetics, D for plot and interesting characters","SO many reviews saying Amazon ""Hit it out of the park"" (actually, a suspicious amount with that same headline), but what exactly did they watch? Because it wasn't Fallout. About the only thing they got right was the look and feel of the environment from the games -- the vaults look like they came straight from the game, so I give them kudos for that. Otherwise, the plot was so bland and uninteresting that each successive episode held my interest less and less until, by about the 6th episode, I felt that I was watching it because I was ""pot-committed"". By the finale, I had it on more as background noise. The characters are terrible, sans Walton Goggins (who is great in everything), although even his character wasn't that captivating. The main character, Lucy, is just too ""Gee, aw shucks!"" to care about, and Maximus' storyline was numbingly ZZZ-inducing. Will there be a season 2 (probably based on the end of the last episode) but this one is better left in the Fallout shelter.",5
You do not need to have played the game to enjoy this series,"This series opens in a time that looks very like the 1950s shortly before rising tensions lead to nuclear destruction. Moving forward two hundred years we find ourselves in Vault 33, one of a number of subterranean structures where the lucky few survived and their descendants await the day that it will be safe to return to the surface and rebuild America. When outsiders manage to enter the vault and kidnap its leader his daughter Lucy heads out into the wasteland hoping to find him. Here she will encounter many dangers. At the same time Maximus, a squire in the Brotherhood of Steel is given the task of assisting the mech-suited Knight Titus on a mission to capture a certain individual. When Titus is killed Maximus dons the armour and continues the mission. Also looking for the individual is a bounty hunter known as 'The Ghoul'... events will lead to these three crossing paths as more is discovered about the world they inhabit; things they don't realise themselves. Back in Vault 33 Lucy's brother Norm gradually learns further facts about the people that run their lives.I've not played the game so have no preconceived ideas about what the show should look like. I can't say whether that is for the better or worse but I can say I really enjoyed it. It quickly and effectively introduced key characters and the world they inhabit and the story moves at a good pace. Every episode provides plenty of tension and fairly violent action as well as interesting revelations. Such a story could easily take itself too seriously but this manages to provide plenty of laugh out loud moments. I thought the cast did a fine job bringing their characters to life. The sets and locations are great; the vaults have a believable look and the locations have a suitably abandoned look. This might be because in at least one case the real long-abandoned town of Kolmanskop, in Namibia, is used. Similarly I liked the use of mostly physical special effects rather than the CGI more modern films and shows use. The retro soundtrack was fun and added to the feel of the action; especially when a light song played over more violent moments. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of post-apocalyptic sci-fi whether you've played the games or not; I can't wait for season two.",9
First season was so damn good.,"I never really played Fallout but lately movie adaptations of games have been very hit & miss, I can't speak about 'lore accuracy' but in terms of story telling, visuals, character development etc.. etc.. I would honestly say this is almost as good as 'The Last of Us' series adaptation was.Very fun show, most of the time you're moved between 4 perspectives from 4 very different characters that cross paths & have their problems & victories together, but the main reason that this works is that you're getting to know the world that Fallout is in from significantly different angles, which is a much nicer way to experience a narrative rather than having 1 person exposition dump everything on you as a lot of other shows do.",10
"An Age-Old Concept, Executed Beautifully","I'm going to preface this by saying that, prior to watching this series, I had never played a Fallout game. Not really. I had downloaded New Vegas a year ago, at the insistence of one of my old friends- then proceeded to go through the intro and hang around in the desert for awhile, shooting random things.In other words, I'm not a gamer by any means. But this series was so gripping and brilliantly put together that it inspired me to play the games, just by the strength of the narrative alone. And I feel like I'm not the only one.Even if I didn't grow up with any kind of console (which may make me something of a dinosaur among Millenials/Gen Z-ers), I appreciated that gaming, as a hobby, came with a series of benefits. It challenges kids to develop strategic thinking. It improves coordination and reaction time. But now, because of this series, I can appreciate it for something else- as a means of storytelling.The pilot episode shows Cooper Howard (played by Walton Goggins, and later known as The Ghoul) entertaining young children at a birthday party. After a brief conversation with his young daughter, a nuclear bomb is dropped on the city, and he flees with her in her arms. The clothing and hairstyles had a 1950's sort of aesthetic, which had me thinking that the story was meant to be alternate history (not to mention the constant fear of a nuclear holocaust, which defined the Cold War era).After jumping ahead 200 years, the story follows three main characters: Lucy McLean, a young woman raised in a vault whose moral compass often overrides her survival instinct; Aspirant Maximus, a reluctant member of the Brotherhood of Steel who finds himself assigned to a mission out in the wasteland; and The Ghoul, now a bounty hunter who has fully embraced his once-fabricated cowboy persona.I had questions. A LOT of questions.One doesn't have to look far to appreciate the real events that inspired the story- Chernobyl, Hiroshima, Nagasaki. The fear of humans destroying themselves as opposed to being destroyed by an outside force (i.e. An act of God) is especially interesting because, no matter what method is used, it would never be absolute. Those who survived the holocaust that wiped out 90% of life on Earth risk being turned into something barely recognized as human, through radiation poisoning. The Vaults, while supposedly designed to sustain life for centuries, would eventually run out of resources- and had already found ways to poison their moral framework long before.The acting was superb on all fronts, as was the script. There's a particularly great piece of dialogue between Cooper Howard and his wife, Barbara, which encapsulates a large part of the franchise's social commentary. What good is preserving life if you lose everything that makes life worth living?None of the characters are truly perfect, and the story doesn't always go where you expect it to. It mixes classic sci-fi thrills with just the right amount of dark comedy.Now, to beat Fallout 3 before Season 2 comes out next year. I can't wait.",9
The ghoul is hot?!,"Yeah this is easily (in my opinion at least) the best video game adaptation I have ever had the pleasure of watching unfold in real time. I have always been a fan of the fallout franchise ever since I played fallout three on the Xbox 360, and to see this vast and interesting world come to life on the screen is incredible and I genuinely loved every single second of it. Some of the most inherently bizarre and beautiful visuals I've ever seen in a television show, I mean dude look at the power armor that's insane, plus every creature looks fantastic, most specifically the ghoul played by the spectacular Walton Goggins (who is the best part of the show by far). Although; the rest of the actors here are stellar as well, Kyle McLachlan of Twin Peaks fame has very little screen time but he uses what he has to its fullest, Ella Purcell absolutely kills it as Lucy and this is the second video game adaptation she has been in that's amazing, plus Aaron Clifton is absolutely hilarious while also somehow badass as Maximus. This is wholeheartedly the best thing I've seen come out this year, either show movie or game, plus easily the best video game adaptation I have ever witnessed. If you haven't started this I highly recommend you start now, it's peak.",10
Great Adaptation!,"This is exactly how a gaming adaptation should be handled, honoring the source material but creating your own story within the universe. Casting was well done and it was clear a lot of work was put into the writing. No cheesy one liners or throw away scenes, everything shown contributed to the narrative and world building. Character arcs were completed and all character interactions had meaning. Great show over all, can't wait for season 2! The producers for Halo should be taking notes. It is possible to keep the gaming community happy, while also creating your own story and appealing to a wider audience.",10
Not too bad,"I'm not a fan of the game, but Uupon watching two episodes of ""Fallout,"" I was surprised to find it receiving such high praise in the IMBD ratings score. However, my experience thus far has left me underwhelmed. One of my main gripes with the series is its reliance on low-tech elements, which seems out of place in a science fiction setting. The technology, particularly the suits worn by the Knights, feels outdated and lacks the innovation one would expect. While the initial introduction of the Knights was impressive, it ultimately fell short of my expectations. I had hoped for a more captivating experience, but unfortunately, I found myself disappointed by the lackluster performance in these first two episodes. So far it's watchable I will watch the remaining episodes.",7
Solid B+ tier. Gets better later on. High hopes for S02,Cheesy b tier script in first 2/3 can easily be looked past if you're a fan of the games.The (Bethesda incarnation) Fallout world and flavour has been captured pretty much perfectly. Fan service is basically baked in and isn't rammed in your face.Brotherhood and Vault lines are OK basically the sort of thing youd expect from the games but the ghoul storyline is actually pretty damn compelling and elevates the whole thing IMO.Final 1/3 actually ramps up the story into something interesting while hitting all the classic fallout tropes of daddy issues and the grey morality of each factions ideology.Season 2 has the potential to claw its way into A tier if they keep pushing.Massively surprised. Cant wait.,9
Wicked and disappointing,"I've got them all and played them all so I was hyper upon finding out there is a series coming.They did an awesome job in replicating the details onscreen from the game.The vault, the world, the music, the outfits, it's all 10/10. And the BoS armor, loved it.The story is very well done and it will take you all the way though the first season before youfind out what it's all about, I liked that. 10/10.Walton Goggins. Nobody could have portrait The Ghoul better than him. His performance is fantastic. 10/10Unfortunately I can't say the same for Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten. I thought their performances were very cringe. 01/10.Would I recommend this, absolutely.",7
"Fallout feels slow and rushed at the same time, and is full of checklists and terrible CGI","1st main protagonist: male, griefing, whiteHis child: exceptionally bright and brave, mixed race for no reason except that's how it works today (compare e.g. The Last of Us)2nd main protagonist: jovial and resilient female, whiteFather figure: wise and kind, on his way out, whiteAll younger men: weak or intimated by life, whiteFirst villain: female, ethnically ambiguous3rd main protagonist: troubled past, has issues with anger, male, blackBest friend of 3rd protagonist: tough and sly, of ambiguous gender, LatinAlrighty, folks. This is really swell. Now that we've went through the mandatory checklist, let's get on with the story. To have as many random scenes as possible, we will split one narrative up into four, understood? We will make it fit later on in the editing room. Don't think of it as a conventional story, or four conventional stories for that matter. It's more like snapshots of that trademarked Fallout feeling.What's that? Speak up if you wanna say something, son! What?! No, Todd, it does not matter if the writing is full of plotholes so big they are actually safety hazards. Main thing to keep in mind is that we're dealing with a hypernervous *gamers* here anyway and they just can't cope with long introductions and thoughtful setups. We have to make as many cuts as possible and also introduce a couple of dozen more characters! Yes, Todd, I'm sure about it. After all, my 11-year-old does play Fortnite so I know a thing or two about the mind of a gamer.Meanwhile, the gamer: *proceeds to play a random Fallout title in which the main story alone is about 50 hours long and happily immerses themselves into the world and there's nothing they hate more than bad action, cheap graphics, stiff dialogue and getting rushed through the story while at the same time being held up with trivial fetch quests*EDIT: My, oh my. It actually gets worse. I already wondered where the Asian typecast was and then they have that tinkery, nerdy woman who likes science and stuff. Guess what ethnicity they chose for that character? It's a very different kind of racism we are in the process of developing and it baffles me that nobody is offended by it. Also, the writing gets worse and the camera is always moving around ever so slightly to mask that nothing is actually happening in the scene. The choreography of the action is amateurish, full of errors and overloaded with bad CGI. I do like the actors and they certainly do their best (esp. Ella Purnell and Aaron Moten, you can see they had fun delving into their characters) but overall, this is yet another series that is already massively overrated. Some other reviewers stated it succinctly: this is much more a Disney production than anything else.EDIT2: A lot of people out there relegate the bad reviews to gamer rage. Funnily enough, there aren't that many 1/10 reviews out there, and much more inflated 9s and 10s. And what's even more curious: if you go to the respective forums, you can easily see that Fallout fans actually love the adaption because it is truthful and full of hidden lore. But I am not only a Fallout fan but also a fan of great TV shows. And this one is simply not one of them.",5
Better story than all the Bethesda games,"I've played all Fallout games except Fallout 76. New Vegas and Fallout 2 had the best written, smartest, most intriguing stories. The Fallout TV series rivals those in complexity, smart character development and skillful twists. The character arcs, build-up and conclusions for each of the 3 main characters is almost perfect. It's so refreshing to see a well-written female character as well as a complex, interesting black character.The only reason I don't give it a 10/10 is the lack of the brilliant dark, humour that Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas had. There are some attempts, but they didn't get a chuckle out of me as much as the games did.Still, one of the best pieces of entertainment on TV in the recent years, right up there with Arcane and Shogun.",9
Worth the wait,"Wow just wow. I've played every Fallout game and gotta say this for a first season was outstanding. The story loosely based on the game was gripping, the chosen characters brilliant. The soundtrack is amazing and I can't wait for season 2. Even if you have never played the games, just sit back hit play and become mesmerized by how the world would look after a nuclear holocaust.The main characters are acted out superbly and The Ghoul is just the best casting ever absolute genius. I binged the whole series and will watch again, please release an album soundtrack.Now prime please pick up Mega City as this deserves the same treatment.",10
"so awesome, so stoked","I been long time player of the games, LOVING every scary moment and laughed with every corny joke, loving the music. I was scared when I learned there was going to make a series of it specially when its launched on Prime, they usually gut everything out of a series and make it watered down nothingness.Not this time, it was everything one could expect, awesomeness , storyline, drama , scary ghouls etc.The only thing I am somewhat sceptical to is the distance.... how could one walk from philadelphia to los angeles or new las vegas in matter of minutes, it should take weeks. But thats just the one tiny remark thats making it not 10/10.",9
It's a hard watch for a canon purist like me but I love it just the same!!,"The original was full of dark humor and well crafted situations. This does that and wraps it up in an intriguing package complete with character arcs. There are things that are very different than from in the game but that just means a clean slate with which to create an admirable story and I appreciate that!! As a fan of the game series, I am very elated to hear that it is doing so well in the ratings. The original creators were imagination powerhouses of the gaming industry. There is plenty of meat on the bone to have gotten creative with for a series. The actors were all pretty amazing and I never knew what to expect next!! Just the way I like my shows!!",9
Absolutely love it..all time favorite show as of now,"I'm super super impressed with the series so far; Start off the storyline amazing;the attention to detail is phenomenal everything that you see know and love in the game is in the series..Everything from weapons,gear,food,clothing, building and landmarks are exactly the same as the game..My jaw dropped at the amazing details;the acting in this is amazing I love every character big and small in this; they all do an amazing job amazing 👏..By the looks of the ending of episode 8 hopefully means there is going to be a season 2 heading towards my favorite game in the series New vegas with death claws..I pray that it happens and in a timely fashion..On top of this being amazingly stunning a look at season 2 teaser looks like it's going to top what we see in season 1..I do wish season had more than 8 episodes;Seems to be the trend no a days..When I was a kid in 90s early 00s seasons had 20-60episodes got your money's worth..Grant it those shows probably didn't cost as much to make but still love more than 8 episodes.",10
What a show,"This is such an awesome show. It's not as I expected at all, even after seeing the trailers.Let me start out by saying this is all comedy. This is not a serious show and it doesn't try to be. It is however, the most fun I've had watching tv, in a long time. So many little funny things, that I'll have to and watch it again in a few weeks. I bet I've missed a bunch.With out spoiling anything, early on we have a sex scene where the guy afterwards gets up, and causally wipes his meat torpedo in the curtains. And in another scene, the camera pans over a bunch of bunks in a military camp, and one recruit is ""polishing his gun"" under the blanket. It's just out to the side, so many will probably miss it. There's so many of these silly and hilarious scenes and they are often placed in the background.Besides that, the casts performance is very good indeed. Especially Walton Goggins is incredible - he's definitely maxed out his charisma stats.Then we have the music. This is probably my favourite soundtrack from any show. Having a massive shootout, while Johnny Cash is blasting from the speakers, is just awesome.And that's probably the best part of the show. The way they have captured the atmosphere from the games. It feels like a funny version of Fallout 4.To finish I'd just like to repeat how awesome Goggins is as The Ghoul. If they make a spin-off about his character, I'd be the first to watch it.",9
"Starts slow, but is genuine","I was bored for the first three episodes. Kind of like the game, the lameness of vault life and the initial leaving of the vault is slow. The story did a good job of building up the mystery of the vault experiments. I loved the ghoul character (props to Walton Gibbens). They did a really good job of sticking to the source materials (the games). I almost felt like I was playing the next fallout game while watching. The lead did an amazing job of being both the naive vault dweller and a capable survivor. My only advice to the team is to speed up things a bit. I am looking forward to the next season!",7
Very much designed for Fallout fans,"I'll be first to say that I am viewing this through rose tinted glasses. The show is full of wonderful set pieces with tons of background details. They captured the essence of Fallout, which to some is probably off putting or hard to follow. Many lore specific details have been modified or removed for brevity and audience understanding. This doesn't take much from the quality of the show too much though. The plot is rather simplistic, and some of the twists are rather easy to see coming and seasoned scifi enthusiists might find the show too easy to follow. The actors were well chosen, acting skill varies but most were good enough. Walter Goggins steals the show in this aspect, Purnell preformed well as a convincing vault dweller. The CGI was not the best in the industry, but only rarely took me out of the experience. The only big qualm I have with the show is that, at times, the grim humor so beloved in the games, borders on too humorous and at times outlandish.",9
Way too much time spent on the Ghoul,"I am surprised at the 9 and 10 star reviews here. I was awaiting this series after seeing a trailer for it a while back. I have played all of the Fallout games so I knew I would like this series. I loved the scenes with Lucy, the Vaults, and the Brotherhood. My lower review score is due to way too much time spent on the Ghoul's story. I didn't time it but it seemed like he had way more time spent on him than anything else.It came to a point where I began fast forwarding his slow, long winded scenes. I was hoping that Lucy would have kept exploring and picking up the cool weapons and encountering more of the creatures we see from the games. The very last scene was very predictable, but I won't mention it since I don't want to spoil it for others. I have yet seen a Prime series that I like have a complete series, so I wouldn't be surprised if this only lasts for one or two seasons.",7
Badly written,"Yea the special effects arent bad, it all looks good, and for a change the acting aint that bad either, but as per usual for Amazon, the writing simply is bad, so its just really hard to take it seriously.Just aint buying it that vault 31 and 32 has ""regular"" meetings and trades, but none of the higher ups notice that they dont know a single one of the people coming over for the trade.Im sorry, but you have interacted and traded with these people all your lives, and all of suddenly all of the ones coming over are completely new faces, and no one gets suspicious?And the bad guys make it into the armory instantly?Its just typical ""bad things happen because they need it to happen for shock value, dosnt matter if it makes any sense or not""...
dont bother making a show if you are not going to put any effort into the writing.",4
Great plot and characters,"Fallout mainly takes place more than 200 years in the future after what was apparently an all-out nuclear war in the 1950's. There are several extended flashbacks to events in the 1950's leading to the nuclear apocalypse. The post-apocalypse world is quite complicated with several different factions and groups competing with each other. Some characters have managed to survive the entire 200 year period from the initial apocalypse to the present time of the show. There are many great songs from the 50's and 60's in the show. Two of the main characters, Lucy and Maximus, are absolutely delightful and often very funny. There are many very funny scenes and dialogue here. In addition, the show is well-plotted with many mysteries that are gradually unraveled. The final show of the first season leaves open several plot questions, so hopefully we can look forward to another season or two. The only negatives are that the physical appearance of the ghouls is horrifying and disgusting. The other negative is too many gun battles with people getting their heads blown off and etc.",8
It clicked with me,"Generally, it's a very well done show. Hard to see such thing these days. Quite entertaining. It basically mixes all the genres you can think of: fantasy, soap opera, crime, mystery, thriller, you name it. Writing is very good, although there are (here and there) plot holes and illogical moments. The big budget shows, but never stands in the way of story telling. Music selection is great (reminds me of Bioshock games 1 nad 2, which came 10 years later). Directions and editing are done routinely, but consistently well. Well done casting and acting, though. I tried to play this game once but gave up after a few hours (I believe it was 4, but forgot: the game was not my cup of tea - too open world, too many dialogues, too many quests and so on: everything ""too many"" for my taste, including bugs in the game). This shows borrows the scenery/visuals and overall atmosphere, but brings a partly original story, leaving a lot of space for many more episodes/seasons, which I'm looking forward to. Very entertaining and immersive. Much better than the game. Obviously, such story is better suited for the tv-show, not the game, but that's a personal opinion. Highly recommended, regardless of games' origin.",8
"This is Phenomenal 10/10 recommend, but... where are the death claws??","This is so good literally watched the whole season in a day and a half.. I couldn't quit... my only question is where were the death claws?? They are a big part of the game and I honestly don't remember seeing one in the show.. but other than that the show is fantastic. The way they depict the brotherhood of steel, the unknowing vault dwellers, the crazy NPCs you run into in the game. They nailed it so good. So if you are wanting to watch a great adaptation of a game this right here is it. I mean they literally nailed it. The ghouls are even spot on...blood gore, dismemberment, rad roach delight.",10
Apocalyptically Sound,"I've never been a particular fan of the Fallout games. However this series is fire. The acting, the story, the aesthetic, everything about it is just spot on. And they took no liberties with making it some political statement. They made it for the purity of the series. And it really shows.So this is a story about a post nuclear world, there are a few factions worth mentioning, the vaulters would be the people who were in the vault during the blast. The ghouls are the people who were not in the vault but through chemical intervention basically survived the blast and live on turning into a form of zombie without the chemicals they need to keep them alive. And everyone else is some kind of faction of human trying to perfect their version of what the new world should be. I'm not going to get into more details than that because of spoilers, but this is a MUST watch.10/10 everything was perfect for what this show is. We need more like this.",10
What did you expect,"As the name implies the fallout out of men and women alike including something cringe, meh I thought of this series as a low budget series with a wacky backstory for a series but men did it brought out the best package in each episode like a surprise to a kids birthday party in fact I've got to admit the best series of the moment until the resume of the boys and other totally knockout series in production right now, I thought I came to the conclusion that I've seen it all but this story packs something different though one will understand as one sees the difference in the making both the story and the characters uniqueness and comparison can be dated on some odd factors seeing how many contradictory events came to play but that makes it all the more enjoyable, it's like sitting back relaxed and let them fallout with their entertainment for your pleasure I gotta say one of the best out there see it and live to tell the tale.",7
"A pleasant, yet welcomed surprise","Before the series aired I never had much interest in watching since I never played the games despite being a big gamer. Thought it would just be another dud like the Halo series on Paramount.After seeing positive reviews on social media I decided to give the show a watch and low and behold, I got hooked.The show has action, humor, good acting and beautiful shots. And best of all, the plot is very intriguing and gets better after each episode along with the writing that makes you care about the two main characters.The show is not perfect, but I would definitely recommend it. I look forward to season 2 and really think Prime has something special here if they expand on the ""good"" of the show.8.6/10.",9
Charisma +10 Intelligence +2,"Visually and comedically spot on.This series hits every note that identifies it as a Fallout story. The characters are quirky and colourful, the landscape equally so.There are plenty of Easter eggs to keep die hard fans happy.HoweverThis series feels like it had several directors, writers and creators fighting over it, the result therefore makes for a somewhat jarring viewing experience.A lot of the comedy misses the mark and falls flat with characters saying some very odd things at odd times.Most of the scenes in Vault 4 make no sense at all.It's definitely one of the better video game to screen adaptations however could have been a lot neater around the edges.",7
Script and directing killed the show for me,"I stopped watching the show midway through the 2nd episode. The costumes and sets are absolutely perfect. The CGI is also really good. The actors do a commendable job with the script they were given. But the script and directing killed the show for me. I rarely knew what the character motivations were, what their goals were. The humor was not funny, it was scripted and childish. The pacing was VERY slow and seemed there only to connect ""events"" which were too cliche, imo. I really wanted to love, like, hell..even be slightly entertained, but I found myself wondering into the 2nd episode why I was wasting my time on another poorly directed/scripted piece of ""entertainment"". This was a complete let down.",3
Is and will probably stay the best show of 2020's,"If you are familiar with fallout, this is how you would want to experience the tv adaptation. Most likely also a decent experience for those that are not familiar with the franchise.Cannot wait for season 2. They did not hold back with season 1 which kept the pace on with just the right amount of past and present storytelling. Plot lines intertwined in a way that made sense and none of them strayed off nor felt bloated.Fallout universe has still a vast vat where the writers can summon epic and mad stories and from the bottom of my heart I hope to see many more episodes. This is entertainment, this is art. I'm glad I got to live to see this.",9
Really nailed the feel of the Fallout universe,"This TV series really did a great job with the whole aesthetic of the Fallout universe. The attention to detail is fantastic. It even starts out like a game with the main character looking for her father. The ghoul really stole the show, definitely my favourite character.The story and events could easily come from one of the games, the happy-go-lucky 50s vibe interspersed with violence, from deadly serious to silly and back again. Just like the game. Bear in mind that most series take a few seasons to find their feet this is a great start and play the games if you haven't, you won't regret it.Really looking forward to season two!",9
Absolutely amazing,"This show proves that game adaptations can be done right, and right here is probably my favourite adaptation, I been a Bethesda fan for years, from elder scrolls to fallout, to Dishonored and many others but the fallout show is phenomenal, it sets the tone of the post apocalyptic world perfectly, Lucy is a great character so is maximus, but the stage light goes to the ghoul, hands down the best character, the show done well with keeping its source material, making the pip boys look accurate to the vault tec uniforms the T-60 power armor, and other set pieces, and I cannot wait to see what they do with season 2 especially with the end of season 1, and if you're a massive fan of fallout keep an eye out on Easter eggs there are loads of them in the show, fallout fan or not, I highly recommend watching this show.",10
Really well done!,"Ok, so I am a huge fan of the games and have been playing them for years now. This movie did an almost perfect job capturing the feel of the game. The only thing I didn't like was how they did the brotherhood, sure they are grade A A-holes but they they did have a sense of honor and dedication to each other in the game, in the show they are just A-holes. Beyond that I couldn't get enough of it! It was fun and action packed, with a good story line. Disregard all the negative comments about the show as I'm sure those people just suck at life lol. I loved the goul, hands down the best character in the show, brutal and self-serving, but still somehow likeable. The fault character (Lucy) is down right perfect in her total innocence, and makes for a ton of funny moments in the show.",10
A masterpiece,"I have played Fallout since the first instalment. I was instantly taken in by the lore, humour and storytelling in a way that showed me that computer games could be as compelling as the best films or tv shows.""Fallout"" reverse engineers that premise, bringing a computer game to the TV screen, and it does so magnificently. For those who care: it captures the lore of Fallout very well.It also captures politics brilliantly.It's hyperbolic, but that's what Fallout always did well -- exaggerates the worst of human instincts to display how bad we can be.This show leaves you with the feeling that there is something amiss about the world, and something sinister under the surface. It's highly compelling. The humour, the weirdness of the games... it's all there.As a bonus, the acting is mostly good to excellent, and it has Matt Berry as Codsworth... so, worth watching for those fleeting scenes alone.One of the best shows I've seen. A masterpiece.",10
"Loved it, unexpected apocalyptic delight","Didn't really know what to expect from this one, I had only played a few hours of various games since I got them on sale. Did not really know much of the cast other than Walton Goggins who is a great actor.The story itself was well explained and cohesive which really brought out elements of the game such as dark humor, music, and NPC interactions which created wonderful immersion in fantasyland of New California Republic. Items and weapons were recreated in all their glory and stayed true to the game while pushing the boundaries. I did find the backstory of the ghoul a bit dull and dragged out (taking up huge portions of the show) and is the only part which I didn't want to really watch more however it was worth it as his past was tied into the present actions. If I were to rewatch this, I would absolutely skip over the ghoul backstory sorry Walton!The one big issue I had with the show was the armor which had parts that were visibly wobbly and not well refined in some scenes despite being an iconic part of the universe. Like when they open the armor, the circular opening hatch just jiggled and that could have been edited. This is like having a wobby lightsabre or flaccid millennium falcon in star wars, come on. But the show catches your attention well with the dark humor ever prevalent in the games, perhaps even better. It would be equivalent to 'The last of us' except that lucy doesn't exist in the games and Jonathan Nolan really was able to push the bounds of a new vault storyline. Best thing was it never felt like mission after mission but flowed well from Lucy to the story unfolding inside the vault to piece together a big picture of how the apocalypse started and why chaos was happening all over the vaults.In this case I loved every bit of Lucy's journey through the post apocalyptic world that is vastly different than every other iteration on TV/movies today (TWD, The 100, last of us, Z nation, etc) making it a refreshing change of pace. The humor was great and the story hints at things that have happened or are happening in the world which were touched on in games. I couldn't really get through the games which were slow and dull but finished the show in 2 days. When it got towards the end I was ready for more, they finished Lucy's mission and created this world with so much happening in the vaults over the globe and all of them could be a different story. The reviews are plenty and speak for themselves, I can't wait for the next seasons or spinoffs that the universe has to offer.",9
You don't fall out with Fallout,"I've watched the first 3 episodes and I started watching with great scepticism, that it would be a 'starts good but fizzles out' series.I also like a good post apocalypse story, this is definitely one of those.I gather it's based on a game, i've never seen the game, but it does have an interesting game vibe that is appealing. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet you are engrossed in the characters and their individual stories (however bizarre)Now I have to watch the remaining episodes and I do hope it continues to the same standard as the first 3 episodes.Solid 7.5/10 and may well increase to an 8/10 by the end .Very watchable.",7
Good overall,"Good music (it's nice that they got some of the songs from the fallout games), good atmosphere, nice setting with an new story set in the fallout universe but that Maximus character has got to be the dumbest guy ever portrayed and I've seen Home Alone. Maybe they tried to make it funny but it isn't. It's cringe. The main character is a dits but it's normal because she grew up in a vault with everyone following that 1950s atomic attitude. All smiles and all rigid but that's how it should be. Also too bad we don't enough scavenging and looting of weapons and armour as in the games but that's ok.",8
Creative liberty isnt always the best,"This show is very good and dont get me wrong with the title. I did personally enjoy the show a lot however what kept me from giving the show a higher score was the amount of story decisions they made too fit the games.The way I see it there are positve and negative aspects to creating a complete original story based on the propertiy of Fallout and I will explain my reasoning.(Also for refrence I am a big Fallout fan and have played all Fallout game entries)The positives of making an original story is that it is a lot more engaging too watch. If they had just adapted Fallout 1 I wouldnt have been shocked at all over the ending or been as engaged in the show tho of course that is really hard to say so take that opinion with a grain of salt. The point is you have the ability to tell a completely new and original story set in the universe which is a good thing.All the references are really neat and its fun too hear the stimpack sound effect or hear the quest clear marker when you reach a location. But some things were a bit cringe like the use of the famous line ""War never changes"", which just felt really shoehorned in near the end.The horror aspect is also something I am very confused by as none of the mainline entry games focus on the horror aspect. However as a tv show I get that adapting the source material and interpreting it in such a way isnt necessarily a bad thing just very unique.The bad parts come when discussing the story of the show. There is a lot of focus on cold fusion and the politics of vault-tec which is something that again, none of the mainline fallout games focus on and the whole concept of cold fusion is never mentioned in any of the Fallout games. Fallout 3 might have the biggest influence on the show since the whole concept of Lucy going out to save her dad is taken from the game. Which I dont like because Fallout 3 easily has the worst story ever.The NCR are poorly written and their backstory is quite interesting dating back to fallout 1 and 2 which gets thrown out the window here. New Vegas gets no love as well only showing the strip in the absolute end of the last episode which just seems like they are hyping it up for season 2 so we'll see where that takes us. Apart from that no ceasars legion, no supermutants (in fact the show never even mentions them) but the biggest offense might be the enclave. The enclave are the main villains of Fallouts 2 and 3 and they are featured a little in Fallout 1 as well but here they have practically no impact on the story. Just that the scientist guy escaped from the enclave which might be an allusion to a scientist from Fallout 2 actually, but thats beside the point. They are basically not important too the story whatsoever in fact the brotherhood of steel are the only faction that are featured prominently in the show. Which is a bit of a weird decision since there are many factions that could have made it in. New reno gangs, Vault city, all the factions from san franciso arent mentioned like the hubologists and no fallout 4 factions like railroad or the synths. Brotherhood and enclave are pretty much in all Fallout games so I guess it made sense to mention those but cmon. There is also no GECK but storywise I can understand why you wouldnt want to mention it (Its basically the equivilent of cold fusion in the show).Overall some creative decisions werent my favourite tho I enjoyed the show a lot and wheter it was a ""faithful adaptation"" is up to interpretation. On one hand it was simply adapting the universe which it did fairly well, but on the other the factions, the characters the locations are changed to fit the new creative narrative of the show which is a bit of a shame in my opinion. I think the show would have benifited from adapting more of Fallout 1 and 2, rather than 3 and 4 if that makes sense.I cant wait for season 2 tho and I will definitely come back for more!",7
"Lame, Ugly, & Dishonest","The Budget for this show was $153 million. You could of given any Fallout fan the budget and they would have made a better show, In fact, there already is a better fan-made Fallout show and it's called Nuka Break (Check it out).Obviously, when a video game show or movie gets made Fans are going to be upset because we already know it will be corporate slop that's not true to the game, so no one or myself is really that surprised. But, the Fallout universe is huge, many games across many years and a plethora of lore to work with.They could have made an awesome show from the source material, Instead we get politically correct virtue signaling in a post apocalyptic setting with a Fallout label slapped on it.It lacks the raw, gritty helplessness that the games are known for. This show is more Whimsical, and probably would have been better as a new, original IP without using the Fallout name.",3
Fallout,"Fallout, it seems that things are turning around for video game adaptions. Fallout manages to take the silly, gruesome, complex and chaotic world of the Fallout games and turn it into a compelling tv show. Not a small feat. If anything, the amount of switching in tone this show has it could've gone so much worse.But it's delicate balance of funny, silly, awkward and gruesome is what makes this one of the more unique shows in a while.As a big Fallout fan, especially New Vegas. I had set a low bar for this, how are they going to pull off such a massive world, and such a weird one too. Having Jonathan Nolan behind it gave me some hope. And Goggins helps, as always. But still, I gave it a low chance of succes. Behold my surprise when I binged it in a couple days. This is a genuinely good show. But it took some adjusting.Primarily it leans into the silly *much* more, and it's foundation, art direction and tone of voice lies in the Fallout 4 game mainly. Which it a bit more silly than Fallout 3 or NV who in general are a bit more serious, gritty, and more depressing (as worlds).Directing is great so far. I have some bad memories of Westworld action scenes, especially in later seasons, Nolan is not good at that because it was always a hilarious bullet fest that stood in awkward contrast to the rest of the show. But in Fallout, first off, the firefights and action scenes are perfectly good, and the bit of silliness that they have works because of the universe it is set in.And that takes me to the bit that I needed to adjust to. This is by all aspect, a video game tv show, and it plays by video game RULES. As in it has a lot more comically unrealistic scenes. Whilst both being exceptionally gruesome and gore-y. Therefore it might just be the best video game tv show adaption ever. Because it's not trying to be real life, it's not trying to ground it in our realities. It 's creating a fictious world, and fictious rules to align perfectly with the fictitious rules of games and gaming in general. This is what I needed to accept and once I did I was really enjoying it.Music, pretty perfect, the expected scores. Effective when used for sure. The oldies music really lands the show and puts it right inside the Fallout universe. I could sing all of them by heart. The fact it's the actual music you also hear in the games is icing on the cake.The story is a great way to show the diverse and huge world of Fallout, and we've yet touched the surface. So much to explore and this gave a taste of each. It could go on for a good while.Lore-wise minor changes here and there and mostly some creative choices in certain attitudes and portrayals, but it all made sense to me. None of it stuck out to me as betraying the games in terms of how things work. The BoS are a bit less cool than they should, and more incompetent here, but it's only a division of it. Not the entire thing, so it's easy to look past.Also gore, man, they went all in. And I love them for it. Fallout games are gore-y and they don't stray one bit from that. That's what this show is, it's honest to the game, to an extend I've never seen before.The pacing, it moves along fast, and characters do too, (fast travel..). What I didn't love as much was the coincidental nature of it all, it made the world feel very small and compact when everyone seems to meet up around some random corner every odd episode. If anything, that's my complaint so far, is that the world feels somewhat small. And everything around tends to feel like set dressing very quickly.That being said, for now, Season 1. They really delivered a good time, and I can't wait for S2.",8
"Fun, creative, and full of potential","The first 8 episode season of Fallout is great in so many ways. The series is super fun! It's sci-fi, fantasy style is perfect for this un-realistic, retro-futuristic nuclear fallout setting. The story and character building is done quick, but still feels deep and attaches meaning to the characters backstories before we meet them. The series quickly develops character that we are attached to without even knowing why.The bounty hunter, Cooper Howard, is introduced early in the first episode and ends up as these nuclear-radiated, immortal bounty hunter. While we don't quite know his motives, we are attracted to his unwinding storyline of hurting whoever gets in his way until we learn of his true motives.This series is unique and well done. It's a fun watch but also with meaning and potential behinds it characters Lucy, Maximus, and even Norm. Excited to see the direction of the future seasons and would love to see what other ""experiments"" have been taking place in fallout shelters!",8
Non Gamer Thumbs Up,"I have played video games for much of my life but never have played Fallout and I ahave avoided reviews so I can take it in fresh. Well, I am on board in a big way.The production values are great - settings distinct and admirably few of the normal dystopian cliches and the acting is top notch. Who can't appreciate Walton Goggins when he has sharp dialog, reminiscent of Justified?I have not finished the series yet but felt compelled to write this review because it's so nice to find new content that hits the mark.Gamers who complain about changes - well, I understand...but for noobs like myself, it works and works really well.",10
It can be described in one word: Fun,"This is one of the best TV series ever. Fun, quirky, everything we love about the Fallout series. Plenty of action, plot twists, all of the major characters have great chemistry, and the supporting cast are magnificent. Great casting, great writing, and a lot of attention to detail. You can tell that everybody involved actually played the games, knew the source material, and wrote a fun, entertaining story. The vaults, the pip-boys, the wasteland creatures and characters are all done perfectly. The special effects are seamless, too. From the power armor to the post-apocalyptic landscape, everything is perfect. Gory, brutal, but also quirky and sometimes downright funny.It's great that Amazon has given up the idea of force feeding us with boring, self-righteous political and social propaganda (like a certain mega-expensive series that shall not be named) and is actually back in the entertainment business.",10
A great adaptation of the game - maybe too great,"The environment, characters, music - everything is there.It's hard to complain about the show, because it is essentially a fallout game moved to a Tv-show.Having said that, in a game I can have more patience with some parts of the storytelling not matching up to others. There is so much more to a game than the script that plays in.But in a Tv-show, it doesn't work to have part of the show feel unengaging or questionable at times. Every minute counts.The truth is that most of the time I am loving the show. Others I cringe, or want to skip, because frankly they aren't keeping my interest, or I'm not feeling the writing.So far it also lacks moments that are truly inspiring that will stay with me for years to come.It is a great addition to the latest trend of games turned shows being good. But it doesn't belong with the greats so far.A solid 8.",8
Fallout,"Super good series about the fallout games. The Fallout series is revered for several reasons, captivating players with its immersive post-apocalyptic world, compelling storytelling, intricate lore, and versatile gameplay mechanics. At its core, Fallout offers a unique blend of exploration, decision-making, and role-playing elements that create an unforgettable gaming experience.One of the key draws of the Fallout series is its meticulously crafted post-apocalyptic setting. Set in a retro-futuristic world devastated by nuclear war, the games transport players to a desolate landscape filled with crumbling cities, radioactive wastelands, and mutated creatures. The attention to detail in depicting this world is remarkable, from the rusted remnants of civilization to the hauntingly beautiful landscapes that evoke a sense of both awe and dread. Exploring this world feels like embarking on a journey of discovery, with each location offering its own story to uncover and secrets to reveal.However, what truly sets the Fallout series apart is its focus on player choice and consequence. Throughout the games, players are faced with a multitude of decisions that can shape the world around them, from choosing whether to help or hinder various factions to deciding the fate of entire settlements. These choices not only impact the immediate outcome of quests but also have far-reaching consequences that can influence the course of the game's narrative. This freedom to carve out your own path and see the repercussions of your actions is incredibly empowering and adds a layer of depth to the gameplay that few other series can match.Moreover, the Fallout series is renowned for its rich lore and storytelling. The games are filled with memorable characters, intriguing factions, and thought-provoking moral dilemmas that challenge players to consider the ethical implications of their decisions. Whether uncovering the sinister experiments of the Vault-Tec Corporation or delving into the politics of the post-war wasteland, there is always a fascinating story waiting to be discovered. The writing in the Fallout series is top-notch, with sharp dialogue, dark humor, and poignant moments that resonate long after the game is over.In addition to its narrative strengths, the Fallout series offers a wide array of gameplay mechanics that cater to different playstyles. Whether you prefer to engage in intense gunfights, utilize stealth and hacking to outsmart your enemies, or negotiate your way out of conflicts through dialogue options, there is something for everyone in the wasteland. The series also features a robust character progression system, allowing players to customize their skills, abilities, and perks to suit their preferred playstyle. This depth of gameplay ensures that each playthrough feels fresh and engaging, encouraging players to experiment with different approaches and strategies.Furthermore, the Fallout series has a passionate and dedicated community of fans who have kept the games alive through mods, fan creations, and community events. The modding community, in particular, has played a significant role in extending the lifespan of the games, with thousands of user-created mods adding new content, enhancing graphics, and fixing bugs. This vibrant community adds to the longevity of the series, ensuring that there is always something new to discover and experience in the wasteland.In conclusion, the Fallout series stands out as one of the greatest RPG franchises of all time due to its immersive world, compelling storytelling, freedom of choice, versatile gameplay mechanics, and dedicated fanbase. Whether you're exploring the ruins of a post-apocalyptic city, engaging in tense negotiations.",10
Good recreation of Game universe except...,"As a person who played every fallout game to completion, including Tactics, this series has done a great job. But there are some cringe moments.In the game, sex was there, but the act itself was an abstraction. It was a PC game with a content rating. In this series, Lucy just outing and asking anyone for sex was weird. Maximus not knowing what sex was, but describing an erection he once had as a pimple was bizarre. A group of female dwellers unzip their vault suits to the waist exposing themselves during a ceremony. I laughed because it was so stupid I couldn't believe they just threw that scene in there. Checking off adult rating boxes could actually derail the story if the writers are not careful.Some errors in mismatched sets. Entering a vault through a building then exiting back into an arid desert. The Goul entering a 2 story farm house and exiting back through a different looking building. Sloppy...Overall the story is good enough and I recommend to watch if you were a fan. If fallout is new to you, then you have to go with there are no Integrated circuit Chips, yet alien fusion tech just showed up in this analog universe. And it does make sense.",7
Solid show from a non video game player,"If your interested in being taken on a strange journey through a strange world that will entertain you and make you laugh out loud at times, then you'll like this show. There's no need to have played the games to enjoy this series. The only thing I'm not really enjoying is the distracting music at times during certain scenes. This seems like a fad these days with productions and I hope it's a style that passes quickly.I disagree with people who say theres no one to route for or any character development, as it seems pretty easy to route for the main character lady from the vault. In any case, I'm not the type of viewer who needs someone to route for in a show or a strong character development journey etc. I think this show is doing a good job of telling the story of this world through it's characters in an interesting way. Sometimes in a story, the main character can be the world and the time period in which the characters are inhabiting. Also the story seems self aware, in that its not a deep statement piece. It's entertainment. And each scene delivers plenty of depth just from its weirdness and set design, acting, comedy, gore, etc.Anyway, it's a show that easily better than a run of the mill series on any platform in my opinion.",9
Amazing mystery,"Season one didn't have me convinced in the first few episode when it embraced the western aspects more than the mystery but when you get information about the world, it's really amazing and the reveal doesn't disappoint. The characters in the vault are a great representation of this aspect as they slowly discover how wrong the world is, their stories was intriguing. Lucy is the character for me as we see her change through the season because of the dangerous adventures she goes through, she starts off has an optimistic idiot and ends up broken. Maximus also had an intriguing story because of how unpredictable he is, he's a good person but also a bit of a coward so his actions are fun to see unfold. The Ghoul was interesting but he's really shielded from exposure because his plotline needs to be flashbacks so as essential he is for the mystery, I think he was slightly misused. On the technical level, the show is awesome, the visuals were on point and the soundtrack slaps.Season 1: 8/10.",
Mostly enjoyable with a pet peeve,Loved the cast and acting and the westworld ish vibes but with an appropriate comic book feel.Amazing score and Nolan/Joy world building ok with what I presume was a much smaller budget. I get similar vibes occasionally especially with the Walter Goggins Ghoul reminiscent of man in black. He's so good and I really like the lead actress. She has those big eyes and looks straight out of an anime.My pet peeve is how did all those post apocalptic people keep their glasses crystal clear.not to mention clean hair. I look like a hobo after two days without a shower.I'm not a gamer so can't speak to how this reflects to the game lore.,7
disappointing..,"Despite the good actors and attractive beginning, unfortunately, the scenario and the story are extremely far-fetched and illogical. I only saw the beginning of the first episode and I have a big question mark as to how they opened the gate without going through a simple security protocol to make sure there are no killers and looters on the other side. I don't even open the door to my house without making sure who is behind the door, how come they didn't care and just pushed a button to open the gate? I'm giving it two stars just because it's called Fallout. If you are going to make a series based on one of the most popular video games, please take it seriously.",2
"Solid Fun. Incredible, believable world.","I don't leave reviews for movies or TV shows ever, but this one deserves all the praise. As a huge fan of the Fallout games, I was not getting my hopes up too much in order to avoid disappointment. This, however, does not disappoint!! I have had not had so much fun watching a show in such a long time. They paid so much attention to detail that it felt like playing the games all over again. The balance of humor, horror, action, and historical elements make for such a unique experience not seen much in television. The creators also made a very memorable story, with some truly gut-wrenching moments. The actors crushed it, too. Go watch this show now!",10
Respects the games and fans while creating something new,"Been a fan of the Fallout games for 10+ years.I had no/low expectations going in but I was captured from the first episode. The great characters, the twisted dark Fallout humor we all love, the great cinematography it all works perfectly.This is what happens when you take what is best about an IP and then build upon that. A perfect example of how to make something for the fans while not just making a straight up adaptation.Jonathan Nolan worked on this and his love for the franchise and amazing skills with directing really shows.One of the main writers for the show has worked on the office US amongst other things and I think that's why the humor is so perfect, at least to me.AND THE END SHOT??????? LETS GOO
10/10.",10
Quite Good But Can Be Improved In Script Writing,"I just finished watching it from beginning to end. I played the PC game Fallout 4 but never finished it. The series at the other hand was very compelling for me at least. Only problem I can find as far as I can see is First Act introducing the world of Fallout although great , is a little bit long and tedious and might be turn over for casual viewer. Fallout starts with a nostalgic jittery aura of an alternate future with 1950'ies aesthatics when bombs begin to fall but then after centuries later we are introduced with a very naive and insular isolated society of vault dwellers living their lived not interracting with any surviving human communities at all ( or so ity seems) From then the story and conspiracy involving it unfolds with flashbacks to pre nuclear war era step by step.The writer Jonathan Nolan's reluctance and deep suspicion of corporate culture and wild free for all capitalism is all plain to see in it. ( there was something similar in his previous tv series Person of Interest and even Michael Emerson from that show guest starring in one episode here in Fallout)Ella Purnell as main heroine Lucy , Vault 33 dweller searching her father is quite a find for me and Aaron Muten as her co star Maximus Brother of Steel squire holds own his own. ( the building romance has a macabre humour in it) But as far as I concerned best performance was from Walton Goggins as Ghoul the Bounty Hunter and his previous Western Actor character before the nuclear war , Cooper Howard. Goggins was great in his dual role especially as badass and snarky Ghoul but I bet he had fun with pre war 1950'ies aestetics driving car or wearing fashion of that era.",8
Definitely one of the best game adaptations and post-apocalyptic TV series.,"I am a gamer, but I had no idea about the Fallout game series and at first I had almost no expectations because adapted movies or TV series are usually bad. That's how I started the series and then I fell in love with it. It has almost all the features a post-apocalyptic genre lover would want. The series has very good actors and a realistic post-apocalyptic world. The story is pretty good, but since this is a spoiler-free review, I won't talk about it here. I've read comments about the series like it doesn't have a dark enough world or story. I can assure you that the character development, tone and story of the series are very suitable for a post-apocalyptic world. The thing that made me most nervous before watching the first trailer of the series was that it presented a ridiculous post-apocalyptic world like Far Cry New Dawn. But what I feared did not happen. I recommend you to watch a series that deserves a lot of effort and deserves its due. Thank you for reading.",9
Fantastic Futuristic Series,"I am not a video game person. I have no prior knowledge of the video games this is based on. I watched this because I heard there was a similarity between this and The Last id US, which I loved. There is some similiarity in that there is a grim, post-apocalyptic setting and a ""quest"", but it has a very different tone. I love the 1950's ""frozen in time"" infused nature of this one. Walter Goggins is always good and this is no exception. The series is littered with commentary about the attempts to live in a Utopian society, and the failings of mankind. It is part sci-fi, part western, part drama and more. It is interesting, visually terrific. Well scripted. It is well Directed. It is very, very watchable. The acting is great. There are many cameos and famous stars throughout. I liked this a lot. There is a lot of thought provoking social and political commentary throughout.",8
"More than just ""Okie Dokey"". Finally a video game based series that is well done!","(No spoilers but references to common items and things seen in the trailer.)As an avid fan, enthusiast, obsessor and collector of everything Fallout since Fallout 4 came out (thank you random GameStop employees in 2015 who suggested the game and series to me I had never heard of before) I was so worried that this TV show would turn out and disastrous and god awful as the Halo Series but I've never been so pleasantly surprised to have my fears waylaid aside.The show is good. Fallout fans will be happy with this. Sure the trailers give away a lot and there are the usual formulaic story progressions and tropes but the show surprises you at times with minor twists and it has its chuckle moments.There is plenty of gore and the main character Lucy's half curses ""gosh dam it"" are cute and enduring. Growing up in the vault we knew she was going to be naive upon leaving the Vaults safety but she has a plausible background of training growing up that allows her to survive in the Wasteland more than just by dumb luck.I love all the nostalgia and lore built into this. The familiar sites and references and things like YummYum Deviled Eggs and Abraxo cleaner is thrown in perfectly.The only thing that could make the show better is the addition of Death Claws (which I'm sure will make their appearance eventually).I will mention just as a fact and as noted in the first few minutes of the series that it takes place ""219 years later"" after the Bombs fell on October 23rd 2077 making the show take place in or around 2296 which puts its story and time as the oldest in the entire series, the closest of which being the events of Fallout 4 in 2287 albeit all the way across the country in the Common Wealth of Boston. Since the airship shown in the trailer is the Prydwen I believe, it's safe to assume the events of Fallout 4 had the Brotherhood of steel ending until proven otherwise. Sorry Institute and bye bye Sean.",9
"Good, but just nog good enough","I played the Fallout games, but it is a long time ago I must admit. Fallout was a good game, with hice stories and a nice world. It has it's own kind of humour. I do not know the story so good, because I like to skip the videos because I want to PLAY the game instead of watching a movie.Now it is the other way around. And I must say: there are times I am feeling it is just like the game. But there is also a moment that I have the same feeling why I don't like the game: the useless filling. If it is on purpose to get this feeling: brilliant!Let's first start with the visuals: very good. Everything looks like the game.The story: also nice, but sometimes I could not totally follow it. Maybe I need to rewatch it. But it is not a difficult story and there are plot twists. And almost everything is solved by a miracle. But I do like the choices everybody needs to make. It is like making your choice in the game. What is the right choice?The acting: for me it is a high level.The costumes: they look really nice. The Brotherhood looks like Power Ranger bots.I like the guns and the sounds. The gore is there. The sillyness. But sometimes I think: it is too easy. If this was a game, it was on story mode. How can you survive that long let alone get through the frist night? The monsters are looking fake but it fits totally. They are weird.So there is nothing really negative. But I feel like there should be more. There is still room for improvement. Like I said, there is no real danger in the world, how can someone from the vault survive that long? And I think season one needs 39 episodes or something. Just as long as the game takes :p.So for me it is a 7.5 but I cannot give it an 8.",7
Reviewed after episode 2: Everything I imagined that I could want.,"I recognize so much in this - the faithfulness demonstrated here to recreate the Fallout world is just astounding, and much of it with practical effects. That's not something you see often these days.There's the right blend of expected humor and seriousness, with dollops of gore that are often presented humorously.The music... oh, wow, this above all brings back the memories of when I played the original Fallout and being introduced to the music of the wonderful Louis Armstrong. I want the OST!!The acting is on point. Everyone seen so far, including the background actors, has been excellent. Ella was well chosen, Aaron Moten has believability, Walton Goggins just shreds each scene he's in, and, as for the other well known talent...I went into this relatively blind, and had no idea Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Emerson were in it! Sure, Emerson plays a stereotype role but, boy, does he do it well.Is it perfect? Nah, there will be parts that people will pick over. For this Fallout fan, though, this satisfied me deeply. Ignore the inevitable YouTubers complaining about ""girl bosses"", they've shown their true colors.I pray that Cavill's WH40k adaptation is at least this good.",9
[7.5+] Are you coming?!,"A mild, mostly realistic but artificial representation of that post-apocalyptic city with heavily interlaced 1950s and 22nd-23rd century vibes, devices, equipment and way of life.It feels incomplete, could have been provided with heavier development as to Cooper Howard's radioactive fate, Lucy's father played mysteriously by Kyle MacLachlan and her mother as well.These incomplete stands and ""plot holes"" hurt the series and are taintedly replaced with the Ghoul's charismatic psycho prowesses and pistol whipping. Also, the character of Michael Emerson was hugely wasted, equaling to the weight of his head mostly. Bad decision in my opinion, to say the least.All that I said and unhappily ""complained"" about had just one purpose. The milking of viewers for a second season and making them go berserkly mad at the long wait till 'Fallout II'.In retrospect, please allow me to praise the mostly speedy development and production of this ""future-cult"" show that has the potential to become equal to or even surpass 'Westworld' quality, if they add some more fusion reactions, more engaging character development and blindingly bright orange-white multi-megaton atomic explosions in the series' future.P.

"A travesty, an act of vandalism.","All stars are for the effects props and costumes which are stellar. (Discounting the face plate it's so dumb.)
They ruined the most intriguing part of fallout lore, The New California Republic.Vaults in the middle of LA known post-war as the Boneyard would've been contacted by or even opened up to the NCR.The removal of mystery upon game endings and of who began the nucular exchange. (Which if it was to be revealed should have been Chinese submarines just off the coast of the US with the assistance of spys sabotaging early warning systems, like the games actually suggest opposed to redditor theory crafting.)I've never believed the conspiracy that ""Bethesda hates Fallout: New Vegas"" untill now. It feels almost like theres malicious intend toward the west coast setting of the game. If they wanted a wild setting with BoS and Enclave they could've gone with just about anywhere, except California, But no they had to rewrite NV and old lore. Literally anywhere else would've been better for the story they told. Almost as if it's just to piss us off.",3
Review from fan of the Games,"To be totally honest, my expectations for this was very mixed as it's obviously a series based off of the video games, which usually means it's going to be really good or complete rubbish. This, was extremely good. It feels high quality, and most of the CGI is fairly decent, story is interesting and definitely plenty of action. 9/10 great series, some episodes really do leave you desperate to know more. It's definitely worth the watch, even if you have no knowledge of the games, but I'd say it probably is slightly more enjoyable if you have played them as it references a lot of the in-game items and mutants.",9
Great adaption,I played the first 2 Fallout games on PC and PS4 which i enjoyed immensely (I've been playing video games since Pong was released before Space Invaders) Great and authentic adaption of the video game and the first scene's of the first episode are quite chilling to see the nuclear bombs go off around LA - great storyline and atmospheric props background effects - the sound track is amazing and fantastic and totally fitting - the acting is exceptional considering the concept so very well done all over - its an outstanding series and deserved many awards - it is amazing how it encapsulates the entire Fallout concept - if you dont enjoy this series you have no imagination!,9
Gives me hope for the future of entertainment.,"I like many of you, have grown tired of the same tedious ideas repeated over and over. Of the trying to please everyone so you please no one boring entertainment of the last 5 or so years. What happened to our stories? What happened to our art? No guts no glory my friends! This show proves it. It has soul. It actually feels like the people that created the show understand the gaming franchise audience and aren't just collecting a check. It feels like they cared and put thought into this. This is much more than a girl meets outside world type of show. It's multilayered in a way that isn't overdone or confusing. The people seem like real and flawed individuals with different agendas and backstories that flesh out their character. The lore is extensive. Looks amazing, costumes great, acting great especially from our leading lady and of course from the always amazing Walton. The themes are incredibly relevant and explored to perfection. It's not preaching to us, it's telling us a story. It's showing us how multifaceted both the individual and humanity is. How people can be both good and bad and that dichotomy might night even exist at all? This show gives me hope that there is really untapped talent out there still waiting to be uncovered. Writers, directors, producers that care. I hope this serves as a wake up call to those who have been giving us the same nonsense for the last 5 years. For real.",10

Awesome,"I went into the show wanting to hate it after the disaster that was the Halo show. I've played the Bethesda games and NV several times and love them and love the lore. Fallout and Bethesda have had some issues lately and I was not thrilled to see that Todd Howard was on this project but they absolutely nailed this show. The plot is great, the writing is amazing for the most part, every character is interesting, there's just enough fan service to the people who played the games, and my wife who has never played any of the games thought it was a little weird but she was hooked the whole way through.",9
Will have to play the game now to compare,"Starring the likes of Walton Goggins, Kyle Maclachlan, Dale Dickey & Erik Estrada this tv show follows the lives of individuals surviving in a post nuclear war world a couple of hundred years after the bombs have hit Los Angeles & people have to live in the safety of underground vaults but when the father of one of them is kidnapped by wasteland raiders in an elaborate ambush then she has to leave the safety of her vault to go & rescue him only to discover he is the one responsible for the nuclear apocalypse in the first place whilst another character she meets finds out his beloved wife also played a part in planning it. After this was recommended to me I didn't think I was going to like it as I'm not really a sci fi fan but it was better than I expected as I enjoyed the imaginative fantasy element to it which really bought the storyline of the characters alive & now I'm going to have to play the game to see how it compares. I've seen better shows but like I said it was better than I expected so if post apocalyptic sci fi fantasy shows are your thing then you might want to give it a go.",7
"Well, okey-dokey!","Never played the games, but I'm a huge fan of the old post-apocalypse going all the way back to my 80s childhood spent watching the likes of the BBC's (terrifying) 1981 version of Day of the Triffids and reading Judge Dredd's Cursed Earth stories in 2000AD. This version of Fallout has to be right up with them as one of the very best of the genre. The characters are brilliantly written, the acting is just fantastic accross the board, the effects work very well and the story leaves us desperate for more. Dark (and often laugh-out-loud) humour, bloody violence and anti-capitalist cynicism abound. Intelligent without being worthy, the show has just the right balance of ideas vs action. The world building is unparalleled - to get quite so much into one series is a significant achievement. One word of advice, it does take a while to build the world and establish the characters. Watch through to the end of Episode 4 if you're undecided after the first three.",10
Not Such A Fantastic Journey,"I have to say it first, I am a gamer. I have never played Fallout, but as someone who can easily spend 100-200 hours in a game, I am careful around series and movies based on video games because a lot can go wrong. Resident Evil is a great example of how things can go wrong and the Last of Us is am example how things can go mostly right. (Outside of Bella ""One Note"" Ramsay that is.)
However, I haven't played Fallout ever so I have no comparisons to the game, I don't know what works for the game or against it on the show and honestly I don't even care.The fact is that from the POV of someone who lives an exciting mystery-thriller-adventure-scifi, this series just doesn't do it for me. The premise is just extremely weird, like the society has not evolved since the Red Scare in the U. S. except some hi-tech cadgets. Come on!The acting is alright, except Aaron Moten akan Maximus cannot act to save his life. He always looks like he is on something, trying to keep his eyes open. There would have been so many more deserving actor for that role.I am aware that when a series is hyped over the top, people are not really allowed to say different opinions, but for me this show just doesn't work as much as even some worse media based on video games. Even Welcome to Raccoon City does more for me than this and the guy who plays Leon S. Kennedy is absolutely awful.",6
"Problems, but overall great.","Let me get this out of the way by just saying WOW! The set design and attention to detail is amazing, and they really outdone themselves. Now, regarding the three main characters? I think its paced fantastically for me, the tone with being goofy and weird but then serious is a really good way to pace a show especially when thats fallout's aesthetic. I don't believe there was a single episode (except maybe the vault 4 plotline, which really didn't need to happen). Now for the important part: is it faithful to the source material?Well...
Quickfire about things that don't make sense compared to the games:
>Shady Sands is not located in the LA
>The Boneyard does not have the 700000 ncr citizens it boasted about in Fallout 2
>The Master (Antagonist of fallout 1 who tracked down vaults) is never mentioned in this show at all, his HQ was in LA and its never explained why Vault 4 or Vault 33 were not discovered by him
>The Brotherhood of Steel becoming the most powerful faction in the region with seemingly no explanation?(This one could be a mistake or actually tremendously bad for the canon) In one of the episodes its explained that in 2277 began the fall of Shady Sands then a arrow pointing to a nuclear explosion. NV takes place in 2281, so if Shady Sands was destroyed in 2277 it DE canonizes NV completely. However, its shown that their is a year below each of the events in Shady Sands timeline but not one under the explosion, they could easily fix this mistake. Great show overall but it has a lot of lore problems regarding the NCR.",8
Long time fan of the game franchise and the show does it justice,"I am a long time fan of the franchise and i can thoroughly say that as the creators explained it, wanting to keep it in the continuity of the series BUT create it's own story; it does it fabulously. Even the first episode as well crafted there were things from the lore that was pulled that Fallout fans would know if you have played the games previously, even Ella Purnell does a brilliant job of displaying the naïve innocence that is common in so many vault dwellers. The fact that we finally got an origin story for Dog Meat that is both believable and convincing is great as well. I will say there are things that caught my eye as being ""off"" but it was mostly cars that didn't look like Corvega's (doing all of them would have been WAY expensive) or the fact that the ghoul makeup should have been a tiny bit more zombie esque even with events but i'm not nitpicking that's minor things.",10
genuinely rememberable,"I have never played this game in my life, but actually throughly enjoyed this show. The aesthetic and easy to follow storyline allows it to be enjoyed by everyone. Some things were difficult to understand (i'm guessing specific parts of the game), but honestly i could grasp the basics and connect to the characters.Ella purnell's acting is in another league, i actually cried in the last episode purely because of her sad eyes. If somebody who has no connection to the game wants to rewatch it, i think it's undoubtedly a show that all fans of the game should watch. I thought it would be a sweeping interest to me, but i been recommending it to all those around me.",9
Nice adaption,"As a big fan of the game I was afraid that the adaptation to a show would be a disappointment full of 'political correctness'. But much to my surprise I really enjoyed the show and there is great recognition of settings and characters. Gadgets, products, stores etc depicted in the game is also depicted in the show and very nicely.There are some downsides, the main ones are the character Maximus, the shallow depiction of the brotherhood of Steele and the somewhat lengthy description of Vaultech before the disaster. Maximus is extremely annoying, both the character and the guy who plays him, hopefully he will not be in season 2 (which I hope will be made).Otherwise regarding the cast, the main character Lucy works well but the Ghoul, played by Goggins is great.",8
This was a fantastic adaptation!,"When I first heard that the game was going to be adapted into live-action, I was disappointed in the news and dreading the result. After watching this series, I am so glad to say that I was wrong, I can't complain at all really. It would be nitpicking to do so. I believe the show is so well done that it could be watched by anyone who has never played the game. You can dive right in and get hooked on this amazing world!I love the way that the film gives you different perspectives of the world and doesn't follow just one person's point of view. The lead character Lucy is a great representation of a player who plays Fallout for the first time due to how naive and innocent she is at the beginning, and true to the game, she's met with VERY hard decisions that evolve her character. 10 out of 10 for me.",10
"Great show, really great video game adoption I have to say","If you have played the Fallout games - which this is based on - it is actually pretty solid if not an excellent adoption !It has a lot of intricacies, mutants, ghouls, factions, wacky dialogue a lot of if not all the aspect that made the game great in the first place.The main characters and their stories are surprisingly well done. Very entertaining.Seeing Benjamin Linus aka Michael Emerson on screen again , it had me almost jump out of the chair in euphoria. He was a character in LOST and there was something tremendously nostalgic having him appear.The game is about exploring the wasteland in an interesting setting, going on an adventure, dangers, adoption to circumstances, survival. This show certainly felt like an adventure . With a well ironed out source material and screenwriting. Well done !",9
Disgusting. Becareful,"I am noticing the degrading quality of current way of story telling and making films in this industry, which employs a disgusting technique to conduct systematic attacks on a normal person's psyche.One of the most subtle technique is to relax the audience first by showing a calm and safe scene or environment...then out of nowehere attack their sense with extremely discomforting scenarios, like animal abuse or extreme violence, mistrust, dropping a atomic bomb on a nice summer day family gathering, other kind 'wanting to shock and attack the open mind' tactics.......
And any type of relationship is reduced to animalistic sex, nothing more, empty, meaningless, there sole purpose is shock value, not creating complex but deeper bonds, just sex = love, but it will turn into hate the next moment because people engaged never knew one another to begin with.....Relax the audience and shock them. Especially with unneccesaary Violence, mistrust and lack of true connection.This show is no exception for employing such disgusting tactics to assault human sensibility and psyche. Our minds when open... begin to trust and take in and ready to really open up to receive more information, thats why they create scenes that build such trust of audience and then bombard them with abusive elements.If people are unaware of this, they just absorb this as normal and even appreciate it, while subconsciously they will be programmed to on a celluar level, because body remembers, to never truly trust and relax into the beneficial nature of reality and human nature.They just want the audience live in subtle mistrust and anxiety and most relationships they show on tv nowadays do not have redeeming, long lasting, deeper bond qualities, it is often disconnected, empty, build mistrust and shock value oriented.I noticed plenty of all that in this series.Nothing deep. Incredibly shallow and empty, and unneccesarily violent.It does not make the world any one bit better.I could not even finish first episode as i recognized what is so rampant in current trend of film making in this one..I pass this, as it's energy is really yucky.",1
"Carried by nostalgia, yet possibly the best Game Adaptation to date","Its mostly a really good show. It adapted the source insanely well, both in aestethic and feel. Anyone who's played the games will probably love this by default as its not just easter egg based references but actually manages to recreate the atmosphere nearly perfectly.Visually its a 10/10 adaptation, the music is mostly from the games which is the best decision they could have made and most of the actors are great in their roles.So why not a 10 ?Take away the nostalgia and the already existing world to build on and the plot itself is mid at best. Its on par with some of the ingame lore you'll get from playing the games. The action pieces are somewhat lacking at times imo. And while the acting is good, some of the characters are just ... bland and uninteresting and spend an awful lot of time just staring at stuff in confusion.Given the stakes set up and the asumed danger around every corner of the wasteland, the amont of time spend just standing around in confusion just does not fit and took me out of it many times througout the show. Especially Maximus but other characters as well.Its fine to get calm moments, but the show got plenty as is and it just doesn't seem right that every character seems to need a moment of deep thought (which is not interesting to look at from a cinematic perspective either if you do it 3 times each episode) in order to decide basicly anything.I get what they tried doing but it just doesn't work imo.",8
"I am 64, not a Gamer and simply Dig this Series!","Skeptical was I beginning this series? Oh Yep.So pleasantly surprised watching a bit? What an understatement! It blew me away.This so exceeds (can't use exceeded yet, only to episode 5) my expectations, it is unfathomably well done. MHO.It's the best Science Fiction, drama, with a bit of subtle humor to a TV series in simply decades. And the soundtrack? Has me reliving the 1960s when I was a baby to nearly 10 years old.Again MHO. Simply the best. Better than all the rest, Science Fiction Television wannabes. If I can steal from Tina Turner? It is simply again, the Best!Well done Netflix.You caught me so off guard with this series!",9
One if the best adaptations I've seen,"Where do I start 🤔 if you're a fan of the game. You will really enjoy it. If you never heard of fallout and it's your first time watching it you might enjoy it. I'm a fan and I definitely enjoyed this show .instead of focusing on one characters they gave you 3 stories and add a concept of big companies are willing to do to win like dropping a bomb on the world.loved the tropes of the fallout world from the weapons, vaults, pipboys, ghouls, (fearl ghouls) brother hood of steel. Just brings you back in time..... I can honestly say I definitely enjoyed watching this show. I hope they get a season 2.",10
It's actually really good,This is actually an incredibly good show with a good solid storyline that keeps viewers entertained and engaged. Now with that said I really kind of hate shows and movies with the whole retro future type thing it really kind of annoys my senses. I'm pretty much all future futuristic all the time still what they did with this show is nice. It's enough gore to keep people satisfied with some what real world challenges(if the world was post apocalyptic/post war) kind of a way the writers did an excellent job telling Fallouts story and the actors played they're parts brilliantly there was no cheeky over acting and the roles that some of the actors had were done pretty well they had dark comedy and enough guts and mayhem to have a good melody. It's not jump out of your seats action with huge expensive explosion(that I like too) it's just good cinema.,8
Worth The Wait,"I know some people have given this show super low reviews. While I do understand some of their sentiments, most are just someone who is upset it isn't exactly 100% perfectly Fallout from every single Fallout game.I thought this show captured the feel of Fallout very well. The scenery IS Fallout. Sure, some things have been changed slightly, but everything just feels like Fallout from one of the various games or a few at the same time. There are tons of Easter Eggs in the series too, and I'm sure I missed a ton more.The lead character played the vault dweller perfectly. I know it's a woman, but you can choose to be a woman in the game. And yes, she is unbelievably capable, but that is explained in the first episode. It almost seems as if she's leveled up while in the vault vs after leaving the vault. At least, that's the way I took it.The producers, directors, actors, and everyone seems to have studied Fallout. It's hard to make a game to TV adaption as well as this was done, and I remember my fair share of tries over the years. This was so well done and I'm absolutely impressed by how much they incorporated from the game so spot on. Even Dogmeat is in the game.I can't decide who I like more.... Lucy McLean or Cooper Howard. Both characters embody Fallout so well. I might need season 2 to help me decide.",10
The Greatest story Bethesda could tell,"I don't understand why people lie in these reviews.There are multiple top rated reviews saying stuff like ""one of the best video game adaptations ever"" and then say stuff like I particularly liked the mutant bandit guy...
Though this one is probably a real person considering no bot would have list of best p*rn actresses which he regularly updates.Or another guy who think nuclear bombs work same way in real life as in fallout and vault tec vaults were actually a good thing rather than twisted experiments.Truth be told i'm sad reading these reviews, as a guy who spent around 600 hours playing fallout games and around 200 hours reading and listening to fallout lore and stories on wiki and youtube respectfully...Why are most of you lying about playing the fallout games ?Why not just say you liked the series and not mention anything about the game ?",9
"Welcome to the wasteland, fellow survivors!","Let me regale you with tales of the epic journey that is the Fallout TV series. Step into the post-apocalyptic world where every decision shapes your destiny. From the radioactive ruins of Vault 111 to the bustling streets of Diamond City, every frame oozes with the gritty charm of the Fallout universe.But what truly sets this series apart is the mesmerizing performance of Walton Goggins as The Ghoul.

Whether he's striking fear into the hearts of raiders or forging unlikely alliances, Goggins commands the screen with an intensity that leaves you craving for more.But fear not, fellow wasteland wanderers, for the brilliance of the Fallout TV series extends far beyond its stellar cast. With its intricate storytelling, jaw-dropping visuals, and pulse-pounding action sequences, each episode is a testament to the unparalleled craftsmanship of the creators.So grab your pip-boy, gear up, and embark on an unforgettable adventure through the irradiated ruins of civilization. The Fallout TV series is an absolute triumph, a must-watch for fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. Prepare to be immersed like never before in the world of Fallout, where every choice matters and the journey is as treacherous as it is exhilarating.",10
Unfortunately I didn't get through the first half of episode 1,"Predictable script and pointlessly obscene violence alongside a heavily 'guardians-of-the-galaxified' musical fight scene.When the main character's proposed husband steps into frame all pouty and slightly rough, it was as if they weren't at all trying to hide that something bad was going to happen. Then follows a ridiculous scene where horrendously violent acts, such as the barrel of a gun being inserted into a man's mouth before the raider shooting at others through the hole in his head, go alongside comic relief characters saying 'funny' things while more slow-mo fighting occurs in the background.Following the atmosphere of the games, the soundtrack was always going to be a big part of this and I understand that the mix of violence and quirky humour was a big part of the games. In a live-action format I don't think this comes across in the same way and the scene I've mostly referred to seemed 'marvel-ised' and when I see films/TV following trends it really takes me out of the moment and discourages me from watching further.",3
We need more like these,Following in the big boots of the Last of Us and Twisted Metal. This continues the tradition of amazing adaptations that are easily digestible and fun for newcomers alike! My wife especially knows nothing about any video games and I am a fan of them all. So when we both love an adaptation I believe that is the sign of a perfect product. My brother and I were able to geek out about all of the tiny references they manage to stuff into every scene and my wife was just interested in the story and new and exciting locations and imagery the show offers. We especially love the cinematography! The shots are so skillfully planned and executed. Thank you for another great and we cannot wait to find out where this show goes.,10
YES! YES! YES! AND YES AGAIN!,"Brilliant series. Binged all 8 episodes, and I'm still hungry for more.I loved the characters, the intrigue, the storyline, the sets, the action, the special effects, the actors, the script, the twists.I loved the ending, the beginning and everything that happened in the middle.I loved the soundtrack, the paradoxical music and the paradoxical societies.I loved the level of gore, the humour found in it and the shock value when it was needed.I loved the creatures, the monsters and the back stories. I loved how fleshed out everyone's character was.I loved that 8 episodes flashed past, even though it accounted for hours of my life.I loved the fight for survival even down to the small things like thirst, hunger and betrayal.I loved the progression from innocence through to adulthood.I feel completely satisfied with season 1, and season 2 cannot come fast enough. Amazing television. Bravo!!! I'm tempted to give my telly a standing ovation.I now have two favourite game to TV adaptations. This and The Last of Us.",10
A flawless Fallout with no filler!,"Every episode is better than the previous, I have never experienced a better interpretation of a video game ever!!! This is show is flawless!!!If the Festa could write a handbook on how they wrote, this show, I would demand that every other studio in the world could follow their notes on how to make it more perfect. Their project of course, Game of Thrones, invincible, all of it. It doesn't matter. The show does it all. I do hope that they eventually make a Skyrim TV series. I think that would be fantastic. Todd Howard is an amazing executive producer, and I hope that he makes more things in the future. 10 out of 10!!!",10
From a non-gamer POV,"I'm not a gamer and had never hears of Fallout until this series.I have to say, I loved it. The visual effects are amazing, the acting is great, the soundtrack is simply fantastic. A great storyline with twists and turns. The Ghoul is brilliantly acted and portrayed.I've just heard series 2 is confirmed which a fab news.I very, very rarely binge a series - boredom kicks in - but I did this in two days and was left still wanting more.There's the right balance of true grim darkness and dark humour without making a mockery of the series or diminishing the tone.I'm not sure I'll be racing to be a gamer but I've certainly enjoyed this series.",10
Great game to TV show adaptation,"It's usually pretty hard to make a show or a movie based off a game, but they did a really good job with this one. I loved the fallout games, so it's cool see the things from the games come to life in this show. I also like that they didn't just focus on the woman leaving the vault. There are actually 3 main characters that you follow and learn more about. The story is very engaging and the characters are interesting.My only issues with the show are that it can be a bit cheesy sometimes, but thankfully not too much, the lighting is not great either and reminds me of a teen show from the Disney channel and the main actress reminds me of someone who came straight out of a Disney show as well.I also wish they made the ghoul look more ghoulish. I've only seen a few episodes so far and I'm hoping to see more ghouls as the story progresses.Update: I finished season one and I can honestly say it gets even better as the season goes on! The cheesy situations go away after the third episode. I also started out really disliking the Ghoul, but by the end of the series, I really started to empathize with him.",9
The Main Charcter is Annoying,"The main character is super annoying- clearly as she is meant to be. She is sheltered from the real world and its horrors, living a fairytale until her life is uprooted.As she ventures across the wasteland in search of her goal, she learns what it takes to survive outside of the vault.The details from the game are nicely crafted into a show.The gore is fairly graphic, the show not shying away from its mother influence.My only complaints would be on the graphics- which are painfully average at certain scenes.I would highly recommend the watch if you are a fan of gore, drama, exhilirating fights, and monsters.",10
It's alright,"First off, I have played the games, NewVegas being my favorite.I like the the very start when the bombs dropped... but I'm having problems with the rest..
Goggins as 'the ghoul' is 🔥. Lucy is OK.I hate everything with the Brotherhood. The whole operation isn't lore accurate and the whole storyline could (and should) be eliminated from the show... make them an outlying force with very limited interaction... what's been written here is junk.The pacing is garbage and some editorial choices are baffling.I basically liked the wasteland roadtrip vibe and the vault story.The show looks great, the soundtrack is great, though a tad overused.Overall. Tolerable... I won't rewatch and I won't beg for Season 2 (I might watch season 2, but I can take it or leave it.)",5
Pleasantly surprised,"As a veteran of Fallout 1 and 2, I was very pleasantly surprised by this adaptation. Upon first viewing, my initial impression was ""a very solid six"", but, at the time of writing this review, that has grown to an eight. An intelligently set and presented main story, which is also elegantly and wittily served sharp criticism of run amok capitalism and profit-motivated existence. Typical Fallout toilet humor, perfect background music, striking post-apocalyptic locations, great cast ... although not completely without flaws (occasional banality and cheapness), this is certainly one of the best screen adaptations of a video game.",8
Finally a worthy game adaptation!,"How it has taken this long for an excellent game adaptation is mind boggling. Fallout smashed it out of the park! Really captures the ruthlessness of the wastelands juxtaposed with the naivety of the vault inhabitants. Walton Goggins as the Ghoul is such a stellar casting and he delivers every second he's on frame. Fallout was ripe for the picking but after so many failures (see Halo, Witcher, every resident evil etc etc) this is a massive breathe of fresh air and I hope it paves the way for more high quality adaptations in the future. Well done Amazon, MGM and all the cast and crew on a brilliant first season.",9
Wonderful,"Having enjoyed Fallout 2, 3, New Vegas, and 4, I was curious about this show but not hopeful. There are so many ways they could have messed it up. Instead, it's almost perfect. The people who worked on it have clearly played the game and know what makes it fun. The details are spot on, from the peeling paint in ruined houses to the leather armor of the raiders, from the fifties crooner music to what a player actually says while fighting a yao guai.They also made the right choice in not trying to adapt a story from the game, but making a new story in the world of the game. And the characters are a lot better. I shouldn't be surprised that professional actors can bring a character to life better than game coders -- and yet, some adaptations fail at this.The show is great in ways that are easy to take for granted. They didn't have to make it with the offbeat humor of Repo Man, the casual brutality of The Boys, or the eye-popping scruffiness of Terry Gilliam. But they did. From dialogue to set design, the little things are full of creativity.My only complaint is that the plot feels forced, less what would really happen and more what has to happen to get the story where they already decided it's going. And I would have liked to see more random wasteland encounters and less politics, because that's how I play the game.This is the best video game adaptation so far, and will probably remain the best video game adaptation for a long time to come. I'm excited about what they might do with a higher budget in season 2.",9
You have permission to get your Fallout geek on! <3,"I cried. Seriously. Tears of joy. My husband calls me the Ice Queen cause I never cry. We'll once, but that's another story. Literally. Game of Thrones, like 12 in years ago, but back to my Fallout Obsession... Omg! Love this show! I'm a HUGE Fallout geek, like 100% achievement completion in ALL games on ALL platforms. I've played well over 2000 hours for EACH game. I have 1:1 scale Fallout weapons displayed on my wall framing my 70in tv and I have a Fallout shrine. So believe me when I say this is completely fun and a great show! Some props could be a little better quality (power armor looks a little ""floppy"" or cheaply made in certain scenes) but it is well worth the great 8 hour experience! Binged it all. I can't wait to see season 2 in New Vegas! Yaaaas! ""The truth is, the game was rigged from the start"", ""because hey, in New Vegas, you never know""! Thank you Jonathan Nolan!",9
This is why video games should be TV shows.,"Hats off, bouquet of flowers, rounds of applause and everything else to the creators of Fallout. Thank you for bringing one of my favorite video game series to life. You all created the perfect iteration of Fallout and we love you for it. The amount of detail included from the gamew was ao appreciated. Excellent multiple story lines and writing, gorgeous cinematography, home run acting from everyone involved and the feeling the entire 8 episodes that the showrunners knew what they were doing and delivered it ten fold. Ella Purnell was incredible as Lucy and portrayed the comedic naivety, strength and relatability for people who do not know of Fallout. Aaron Moten as Maximus was great and Walton Goggins as Cooper/The Ghoul is a remider that he is one of the best actors on the planet. Thank you so much and cannot wait for season 2 and beyond 👏",9
Perfect Adaptation,"I binge watched the series in 2 days, and had an absolute blast!The humor the games have is here, the characters are on spot, the world is well built, and the series are perfectly true to its original source.One striking thing for me in games was the music choice. I was really satisfied that the series also used the same themes.People that did not played any of the games might find themselves a bit lost, because although the references are explained, they are done in a fast mode. Regardless, I believe it is a must watch series for everyone, and might make the fans returning them once again.",10
Sigh..,"I really enjoyed the games but I regret that I've seen this show.The thing that's really good about this is the accuracy of the environment and the props. It's really well made. And the music and mood but seriously! The script is as it was written by a teenager. It's incredibly stupid. The plot makes no sense. The characters are really uninteresting and doesn't make any sense.The T-60 suite is cringy. The way the wearers speech becomes slowed down is just embarrassing.It feels like they had an entire world - the world of fallaout - to get ideas from, and they had all this money to create the setting. Why can't they spend some money on some descent script? I'm truly disappointed.",2
Immersive and Faithful: A Fallout Fan's Take on the New TV Series,"The series was captivating from the outset, growing increasingly compelling up to the thrilling conclusion of the first season. It's incredibly addictive-I've heard numerous people mention binge-watching it in just one or two days because they couldn't pull themselves away. As a veteran of the games, I found that the series faithfully caters to longtime fans while also excelling as a high-quality TV show in its own right. The balance is struck beautifully, and I'm eagerly anticipating the next season.The characters are both flawed and fascinating, feeling instantly familiar to those of us familiar with the games. I wholeheartedly recommend this show.It's important to remember that this series is intended for fans of all the Fallout games, not just those who prefer ""New Vegas."" Every fan has their favorite, and the series doesn't favor just one.The acting is outstanding, the casting is spot-on, and the effects are decent, though I expect they will be even better in Season 2, which is thankfully already confirmed.The storyline aligns well with the narratives typical of the games. I have mixed feelings about the inclusion of nudity; it seemed unnecessary and out of place, as if added just for the sake of inclusion in one episode.This season is rich with Fallout lore, hinting at the depth still to explore in future seasons. With so much lore available, it's clear that it would take several seasons to even scratch the surface.Having watched all eight episodes, my only grievance is wishing there were at least a couple more in this season. Those new to Fallout might find some aspects baffling, but that's to be expected. I'm patiently waiting for Season 2!",10
I played the game and the show did a good job!,I was fired from my job and it was worth it. Just kidding lol but seriously this show is amazing. Wow! I was almost feeling like I was in the game when I was watching the TV show. I was like... Nope dont do that or this is going to happen! I told you so! You didnt listen to me! LOL Like the TV screen can hear me and she was going to heed my advice and change the outcome. What good show and I binged the whole Season and could not stop! This show was so good that I was on steam gaming today looking at buying all the games and playing them again like I did on console that I no longer have. Be warned because this TV show is very dark! It shows a side of humanity that no one wants to see and that we hope will never come to pass.,10
Amazing,Never played the game. Loved the series second time a round going. Lost is allso my favourite someone from there is always a major plus. Cant wait for second season. Lots of things happening. Really saw my self as an naive vault person. Hopefully will be a hit like the last of us. Personally prefer fallout better if would have to choose. Casting done well yellowjackets another one of my favourites. Really happy that prime had a huge hit in their hands guessing and understood this is a major hit. Dont seem like they spended billions on production and marketing like the last of us so have to think that as well.,9
"War, War Never Changes....","Well folks, I firstly have to say that this is an amazing 1st season. It is 8 episodes that all feel worthy. The cast are great, the story is good, the Fallout injections of lore are fabulous and there are some funny elements to this that if you've played the game should put a smile on your face.If you haven't played the game, is this still a worthy watch? Yes. I think this could potentially be a good primer with a caveat that I'll talk about later.The gore feels very appropriate. The game itself has always involved that kind of gross detail. It was a stark reality to match the stark wasteland. The Bloody Mess perk springs to mind.There are some fun little Easter eggs in this 1st season that somewhat hark back to the nature of the game. If you are eagle eyed you'll spot them.There were some issues that dug in my ribs but they aren't so much a critique of the entertainment I received but more a direction that Bethesda have. For many people, they didn't play Fallout 1 and 2, where a lot of the original lore for this huge universe is derived.The New California Republic is a hot-button for fallout fans. And I believe that how they were covered in this season is problematic to a degree. Moldaver doesn't make sense. We are to believe that she is a ghoul, she doesn't look like one. This is a perversion of how ghoul mechanics work and sticks in your side. She didn't emerge from a cryo pod, so she is an anomaly that I don't like. If she was true to form, she would have been president instead of Tandi. What this smacks of is Bethesda and Todd's somewhat petty grievance with the Obsidian, Black Isle and Interplay fallout of the past, and this gave them the opportunity to solve a thorn in their side by re-writing history.What I did like is the handling of Vault-Tec. I loved all of the vaults. Vault 31, 32 and 33 all make sense, as does Vault 4. Chef's kiss.I always liked the Enclave, so I am happy that somehow they have returned. But Many fans will have a problem with this. Because they were wiped out in no uncertain terms. I'm also disappointed we didn't see any super mutants or deathclaws. The only hint of Deathclaws is right at the end of the final episode of season 1 where the former overseer in his power armour puts his foot right by a deathclaw skull as he is making his way to New Vegas.The brotherhood is somewhat questionable. It doesn't ring quite true. The West coast Brotherhood should be quite different to the East Coast, but it can be explained away.The caveat I mentioned further up. Is this a good primer. Well it depends. I think that some things have been changed to stretch to fit in some degrees. There has been some artistic licence that doesn't quite hit right. There has also been some historical re-writing that I'm less than happy about which will confuse or pit new fallout fans against existing ones.That said, I think they did a great job and I'm down for a second season. New Vegas should be fun.Could we get Ron Perlman back to say the line. Just say the line Ron. Please.",8
"More, More, and more! So good so accurate!","Rating: 9.7/10As a long-time fan of the Fallout video game series, I approached the Fallout TV Show with a mix of excitement and trepidation. Would it live up to the rich, post-apocalyptic world that had been so carefully crafted over the years? I'm thrilled to report that not only did the show meet my expectations-it exceeded them.The creators of the Fallout TV Show have done something remarkable: they've captured the essence of the original games with such fidelity that it feels like stepping into the screen. The attention to detail in the lore is meticulous, preserving the series' history and expanding upon it in ways that feel both fresh and familiar.One of the most striking aspects of the show is how it encapsulates the 1950s aesthetic-a core element of the game's identity. The era's influence is woven throughout the narrative, not just as a visual motif but as a thematic undercurrent that echoes the game's commentary on American culture. The show's title, 'Vise Versa,' cleverly hints at the intertwining of past and future, a theme that resonates deeply with fans, like myself.In conclusion, this show really does prove that it can show potential to the original, amazing show, and im eager for more!",9
One of the best games brought to life!,"Can't help but fanboy out at this show! The pre-war and Vault set pieces are straight out of the games, with that retro-futuristic blend of awesome that makes this universe so compelling. The show has solid attention to detail in so many awesome ways. Also, I like the Die Hard nod with Lucy McLean's name coupled with her badassery.Seeing the training camp for the Brotherhood of Steel, and the realistic way their culture is put to film is awesome. I'm one episode in and hooked. Can't wait to see where this show goes! I'll throw in more as I binge the hell out of it. Based off of Epsidode 1, though, sits at a 9/10 for shows.",9
Fantastic adaptation,"The best thing about this show is that they've managed to capture the feeling of booting up a new Fallout game. The world has such a unique feeling and tone - upbeat yet dark, nostalgic yet futuristic, comedic yet strangely mournful - and boy have they delivered with this. Doubly so when a sizable portion of the audience was pre-prepared to hate it, and have clearly flipped upon viewing.Honestly if you enjoy fallout as a game, and even if you don't, then its worth watching at least the first episode. The plot is pretty simplistic, but that's fine when the world and the characters are both done so well.",10
This show is amazing,"(No spoilers, just raving review)I think a lot of people didn't have very high expectations for this show, and I'm seeing now that they are eating their words.Everything about this show is 10/10 entertainment. The scenery is stunning, the characters are complex and likable, and the story is just so interesting. They did an excellent job of keeping true to the game. I will watch over and over.I am extremely impressed with the production value as well. It is clear that they have done their research and made this show with the fans of the games in mind. Hopefully, we will see many more seasons to come.",10
Original and refreshing,"I have not played the games, did not even know what this was about.I have to say however, that I am generally a fan of sci-fi, futuristic and dystopian stories.This series totally surprised me with how well it is constructed, from story and direction, to music and acting. I found some elements in its direction particularly original and I have watched a lot of series and movies.Walton Goggins totally nails it, as well as Ella Purnell who is both stunning and talented. I had already noticed her in Yellowjackets, but this is a much bigger role and we see her clearly refined.Not much more to say, if you are fan of dystopian sceneries and do not mind a little bit of splatter, then this is a must watch!",10
It's fallout. For real!,"It's exactly what I wanted a game to look like on the screen. It's fun. It's NOT for kids so I'm glad I didn't just watch it with the family. It's very adult content which is to be expected.This show is what a fallout world would look like. It's harsh with all the environments like the wasteland, Philly and every other part of fallout universe. It's grimy and that's what I was looking for. That being said. It also is quirky and goofy in some aspects as is the actual games so it all makes sense.I would recommend this for anyone who loves the games but I'm sure they have already watched it. For everyone else it's a darkly, fun, sci-fi romp around a wastelands. I'm glad we got to see before the war!",9
Thumbs up from me,"This series is Breaking Bad levels of awesome, it has some nice nods to the games, excellent humour, great use of bullet time that doesn't become an overused gimmick, and a phenomenal plot that twists and turns, and fits in really well with the games.The sound, CGI, costumes, set design and music are all impeccable and really bring the Fallout world from the games to life. It was SO much better than I expected it to be.The storyline is unpredictable, quirky and funny, and builds to an epic finale.I cannot wait for Season 2 and will definitely watch this through a second time. Really highly recommended.",10
A great TV adaption of the Fallout universe!,"The first season of the Fallout TV series beautifully leverages the rich universe of the games, offering a captivating narrative that surpasses the main quests of Bethesda's original games without doubt. With meticulous attention to detail, the sets immerse viewers in a post-apocalyptic world without relying too heavily on CGI. The infusion of well-timed humor adds depth to the story, making it not just a faithful adaptation but also a highly enjoyable experience. In essence, it sets a new standard for video game adaptations, proving that the transition from console to screen can be a resounding success.",10
"Wow, a job well done!!","All I can say is wow, what a great adaptation of the Fallout world. With the Fallout games, particularly Fallout New Vegas, being my favourite game of all time, when news broke of the show being released, I was excited but nervous.....but let me clear this up.....this was wonderful to watch, from a fan, I applaud the team behind the show and welcome season 2 with open arms. Everything from the sounds the pip boy makes to the stimpak sounds, to the heavy footed sounds of the BoS, it just got better and better. Walter Goggins in it was excellent too, truly a masterpiece and I feel proud that a game I love now has an excellent show to accompany it.",10
"After ALL THAT MONEY SPENT, Fallout Barely Earns Five Stars. Here's Why:","The main reason is because basing a sci-Fi drama on a weak plotted video game is just really dumb, and egotistically disrespectful of entire generations of people who do not, nor would they ever, play (or enjoy) mindless video games. Trying to transfer the plotless nothingness of video games into an involved TV drama is a real oxymoron, and ultimately doomed to fail.We humans love the theater, movies, and TV because we love the human melodrama. This gore-fest gave us none of that.Another reason Fallout scores low is the lack of compelling characters for the viewer to care about. While all the characters were somewhat interesting in their own way, with a special kudos to Goggin's multi-faceted ghoul, Arias' over-thinking, depressed, brother Norm; and Dickey's hardened Ma June, store proprietor; Nevertheless, over this eight-episode slog, and all the never-ending mayhem - the lack of real story, and some really poor dialogue: ""You want to have sex?"" ""What? Use my cock?"" (Shaking my head and rolling my eyes)
It just put the characters in spinning circles and brief cameos. We viewers had little to no empathy with any of them. Besides that, what with the endless wholesale slaughter, we knew that they would be dead soon anyways.I feel that, although the production crew and special effects people really went above and beyond with the post-apocalyptic sets, CGV, desert scenes, costumes, and makeup to successfully create their dystopian world; still, all this effort and skill can't make up for what lacks in a coherent script and cohesive direction. I got the distinct impression that this was a ""For Gen Z and Millennials ONLY"" TV program, and I felt truly excluded. This is NOT the spirit of good Sci-Fi, ask H. G. Wells and other imaginative writers. Well told sci-Fi stories should be enjoyable by all age groups. This elaborate video game was not.(4.5 stars out of 10)",5
Best series I've seen in years,"Such a perfect well made show. I'm in the of watching it for the second time and it still feels like I'm watching it for the first time as I'm finding new things that I never caught the first time round. I'm looking forward to season 2 and hopefully a 3,4 and 5 tbh. They nailed the fallout world/ vibes. It makes me want to jump back into the games! There's never a boring scene either every episode keeps me invested. I'm a fan of fallout but I've only ever played fallout 4 so there's bits of the lore that I don't know about but this show makes me want to go back and play the older games and learn about everything and just fall in love with the universe even more.",10
A must-watch bombastic series.,"'Fallout : Season 1' is bombastic series that does justice to the original source. As a fan of some of the Bethesda games, I have to say it bring the Bethesda storytelling magic into this series, where one could question the ethical dilemma with their final action and doesn't shy away from a tragic and convincing background.Ella Purnell does a great job portraying the main character as a naive person who doesn't know real world, and I have to say Walton Goggins playing the Ghoul is the main course of this fine dining series.I love that this series brings the irony approach to the story and directing, where we could see a contrast reality between two world and one could questions the theme of post apocalypse. Just as the first episode talking about the end, and ends with the beginning. Absolutely love the show, very recommended.",9
Possibly the best videogame to TV/film adaptation ever,"I've played all the Fallout videogames from start to finish since Fallout 1 was released in the 1990s and I can honestly say this faithfully captures the essence of the franchise. This series is not just entertaining, it's thought provoking. To be honest I was shocked at how good it was, I was half expecting a 'Rings of Power' or 'Wheel of Time type debacle' but instead we may have the best videogame to TV / Film adaptation ever.The writing is excellent and the way the main three protagonists evolve given the revelations regarding their backstory is great.I think the complainers will say things like 'diversity' this and 'inclusion that' in the casting but forget that; focus on the story for once and you will thoroughly enjoy it.",9
And there it happened!,"And there we go, EXACTLY what I and many others have been saying for years. When doing a show or movie or whatever, on an already existing IP, you should not be doing ""Your own thing"". You should do the IP you just acquired. May sound simple but oh man, how many times, in recent memory, have we seen fantastic IPs completely butchered by showrunners ""Doing their own thing""?The Fallout series does exactly what a show like this SHOULD do. As a hardcore fan since FO3 I can happily say that the Fallout show delivers some eye-watering moments of the true Fallout experience. Excessive violence, bleak futuristic sceneries blended with easy humor. Sceneries, costumes and characters looks fantastic. The story is pretty good, it goes a hilariously IP-typical route that we´ve already been down on, but that doesn´t bother me, its all very well done and the final is just soo good. The cast does a fantastic job all the way and, as a Fallout fan, I don´t think I could ask for more than this. I really look forward to the next season!",10
Really Well Done!,Really enjoyed this - it actually starts a little slow - they take a while to let the story develop and to let the characters grow - but about 4 episodes in it really comes together. Thoroughly enjoyed it. And clearly there's more to come. And that's about the jest of it without saying too much. But there are a few plot twists in there - and I'm looking forward to the next season. Only wish this one was a few episodes longer.

A Radiant Addition to the Wasteland: Fallout TV Series Review,"The Fallout TV series has finally arrived, and it does not disappoint.

Finally a TV show,There hasn't been a good tv show in decades. This is what i'm talking about!!!!!! REAL FILM PRODUCTION right here. Breathtaking. Great attacking. Phenomenal. Nowadays the premise of a show will have so much hope but the actors are terrible... vise versa. This is a masterpiece. And maybe our standards are too low these days! Bring back good shows!!! What a great step in the right direction. Can't wait for season 2 let's just hope it doesn't take too long due to the current mental focus span we have these days. I am only on episode 1... but seriously blown away by how it's so good already and finally something for me to watch and actually enjoy.,10
Not just for the fans,"I just finished all episodes. Oh man, it left me craving for more. Fallout is definately a great fan service with spot-on visuals, lore and easter eggs. It does a good job of presenting the world and characters after which the story really kicks in. I would argue that people who give bad reviews becaue of the plot, have only watched first few episodes. Those episodes are for world building. But it's also good TV in general.Fallout has very seemless mix of violence, action, humor and drama. Story telling goes in two timelines which often breaks the pace of many other shows. But not in Fallout. You can feel that the showrunners care for their product. There is a feeling they have already planned plot-arch over several seasons. Pacing is excellent for compared to any other show. Action is only used when it serves the plot. There aren't forced action scenes just for the sake of it. Characters are given the time to mature. There's plenty of shades in main ones as they change during the season. Lucy is a spot-on protagonist. She brings humor and humane touch to the show, but she's also decisive, smart and vulnerable. Great character. And Ella Purnell delivers. The Ghoul obviously is cool as a cucumber, but he also has depth.Plot is interesting and story is told in an interesting and gripping way. Mysteries are solved piece by piece. It's also refreshing that nothing is spoon fed and there's no forced political message. Viewers can figure stuff out themselves. It does a rare job of presenting the world and characters in an interesting way. You really care what happens to them. For those who are unfamiliar with the franchise, the pacing is just right to understand what's this all about. For the fans, it's constant eye and ear candy.",9
Loved it.,"I love how it takes place in the Fallout universe that's already established. Yet offers something fresh at every turn. Every prop, Battle, conversation feels right out of the games. Even the SPECIAL system is referenced. Theres many easter eggs for those that have played the games. The plot is solid, and twisted. And you really atart to care about the characters. And you don't have to know anything about the universe to understand and enjoy the show. Though it does make it more enjoyable! You can tell this show was made by fans. My only issue is, is the sex and nudity. The games don't have any nudity (but does have some sexual jokes). I really wanted to enjoy this show with my son who plays the games.",9
Fantastic Fallout!,"This series is a phenomenal adaptation of the games! I wanted to atleast make this series last me a week or two, but it was too good not to binge. If you love the Fallout games like me you will love this series. It has made me want to dive back into the games.I honestly had low expectations coming in given there are not a lot of great video game adaptations to live action, but this blew my mind with how good it was. Honestly I do not have a bad word to say about it. The acting performances were great, the story and writing were great, the sets and costumes were great, and the call backs to the video games were great. I feel like this show actually deserves awards.",10
A lot better than anticipated,"This adaptation for me tows the line well between staying true to it's orgins and creating something new.Stylistically, it definitely leans more towards Fallout 4 and 76, but in terms of the plot, lore and established locations, factions and various creatures, brands and companies, it takes from all the Fallout games.In terms of dialogue, plot and characters, the writing is decent, with a great mixture of humour and darkness, but it's definitely aided by already established lore and a world crafted by nearly 3 decades of games. The greatest asset of the show though, is Walton Goggins' absolute masterclass portrayal of Movie star-turned-Ghoul, Cooper Howard. Goggins, like in every role he plays, immerses himself in the character, whilst bringing his unique voice, cadence, humour and expressiveness to his character.Overall, this show is a wonderful adaptation with enough to draw in people unfamiliar with the video game series, but importantly also enough for the majority of fans of the games to really buy into it. I'm excited to see what the second season brings!",8
Worth the watch,"I really enjoyed this adaptation of Fallout. It's relatable, dark, humorous and entertaining. I was hooked just after one episode. The story line is very well thought out and full of twists and turns. This post apocalyptic world is so different and interesting it keeps you coming back for more. The final episode of the first season has you reeling for the next one. In my opinion it will absolutely requires a second season, and maybe even a third since the 3 vaults are interlinked and so are so many characters stories. I can not wait to see if they continue this series, as I see it's potential.",8
Nuka-Cola Tested. Pip Boy Approved,"As a dabbler in the Fallout games having only played Fallout 4 in its entirety and then some yet experiencing the likes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas briefly, I went into this one with low expectations and tickle me pink as I found myself not only liking it but finding it to be pretty great overall. From the acting to the setting and even the old school music soundtrack, which is a staple of the Fallout series, is spot on thru and thru. The plot is evenly paced focusing on 3 main characters along with various sub-characters and even with all of the time jumping it does from the past to present, I felt like it was so tightly wounded that when all the main characters converge in the finale there was such a satisfying payoff. What begins as a simple rescue mission ends in a culmination of various revelations that change the characters worlds as they know it. I was also fearing that the show would suffer the plague known as ""The Girl Boss"" where insert Mary Sue here who's immediately overpowered and invincible isn't faced with many challenges or hurdles to overcome and rest assured dear viewer that isn't the case here when it comes to Lucy the vault dweller. She's naive and vulnerable at the start but the character development on her is very well fleshed out and she becomes quite the sturdy gal by the season finale. This can be said about most of the main characters too. Walton Goggins is especially delightful yet tragic to watch as The Ghoul. Lastly I appreciated all of cool references to the game series such as the weapons to radiation equipment like rads items and even the vault tec gear like the Pip Boy. They also nailed the look and feel of not only most of the game's setting but The Brotherhood of Steel power suit and mannerisms as well. I look forward to season two especially after that great tease in the finale's credits to where they're headed next.",8
Overrated,"I gave this show a chance after I saw multiple videos popping up on Youtube channels I watch occasionally claiming that the show was actually good. I didn't really watch through those videos as I didn't want to have the story spoiled and go in as unbiased as possible. My last Fallout game was Fallout 3 which was way over 10 years ago. So I have some experience with the source material but it's not recent.I watched through the first episode and was mildly entertained. The brutality and gore somewhat reflects what you see in the games as well with heads and limbs exploding or being severely injured. There's also several slow motion scenes similar to what the games do when you do the auto-aim functionality and target specific body parts.The world also looks like Fallout as far as I can tell. You have the post-apocalyptic wastelands with shabby settlements trying to survive. You have the raiders, brotherhood of steel and vaults. The outfits and backgrounds are accurate.The problems start when you look at the writing and characters though. A whole lot of it doesn't really make any sense and it only works if you as the viewer (as well as the characters) aren't actually asking very relevant questions. As soon as your mind starts working though and questions pop up about certain aspects the story completely falls apart. There are multiple factions and there are conflicts among them. Why these conflicts exist though - you'll get a shrug from me because I couldn't figure it out - especially in the last episode when the big showdown starts. The problem is also that way to many character in that one faction just go along with killing random people even though they are supposed to be kind of honorable and so on. It just doesn't make any sense.The season also has an open end leaving a lot of questions on the table for season 2. On one hand it can be good to have an overarching storyline throughout the seasons. On the other hand the ending of season 1 on its own is unsatisfying. So you either watch season 2 or you're left with a mess and that just doesn't deserve a high rating in my opinion.Finally something that also bothered me is that the pacing of the episodes was wildly jumping around. At times it slows to a snail pace with obvious filler content and then at other times it jumps around all over the place and a rapid pace. Especially in the last episode there was one character suddenly popping up in the middle of the battle zone and I was like ""wait, how did you get there unnoticed?"". It just feels off in many aspects resulting in sometimes being boring and then at others slightly overwhelmed with the events happening. There definitely is a lack of consistency here.",5
"Incredible, immersive, expansive, nostalgic","... can't wait for season two! Season one exceeded my expectations and unlike many new interpretations of deep folk lore, this delivered and painted an excellent picture to be enjoyed... the characters were well thought out and fit their respective roles incredibly. Many details that all would see, but deep fans would notice and incredibly enjoy! The season came together beautifully and set the tone and pace smoothly. As someone who is a deep fan and wasn't entirely sure how this would come together, I am entirely pleased and look forward to the next season... I just hope they don't make us wait too long after that cliffhanger! Thank you!",10
Can't wait for season two! (Spoilers),"As the title says, I can't wait for season two! I've never played the games but this show is really making me want to now. I loveee the characters they have the perfect amount for flaws and redeeming qualities to actually make them realistic and likeable. Lucy's naivety had me worried, especially on the bridge scene where Maximus his shot by one of the cannibals. :(In the last few episodes there is a bunch of flashbacks to The Ghoul/ Cooper Howard's past with his wife being the one to actually suggest nuclear fallout (:0) and with him presumably getting blacklisted from Hollywood after bugging Barb's Pipboy.Although Barb being the one to suggest the bombing suggests that she is pretty high up in Vault-Tech, so why would she let the nukes drop when Cooper and Janey were at the party, not safe waiting in a bunker. (Even if she had divorced Cooper wouldn't she want to keep track of Janey?)",10
"Fallout the Series ,not the game, but Brilliant!!!!!","Phew!..for the Diehard game fans, it is very close to the iterations 1 to 4, plus all the mechs, factions, apocalypse now, very strong cast
if you binge it like I did,have lotsa tea breaks..
Goggins playing his usual character, very sympathetic portrayal, and gruesome scenes, not for the fainthearted.Shades of westerworld, ghouls etc.When I first played the game,I played as a female character which was more interesting , the Bethesda launch was somewhat clunky graphics wise, but this then birthed the modding community of the time...
Skyrim wouldn't have beem modded as well if it wasn't for Fallout as they shared the same coding...
It's Funny, Very Dark, Violent, as another reviewer has stated, but stick
with it, if you have the stomach for it.",9
Blew me away,"I have been playing fallout since its inception. I recently started gaming on a gaming laptop now, so I've been porting games I had on my Xbox and PlayStation platforms to it - and Fallout 3 and 4 are the most recent things I installed. I'm almost finished with a replay of Fallout 4 on it, and so this show couldn't have come at a better time.They got SO many things JUST right. It's not over the top, but it is not at all subtle. The look, the feel, the atmosphere, even the music, everything they did, they nailed it. I'm simply amazed at all the tiny little details that are here, that often aren't even in your field of view - you simply catch a glimpse of something out of the corner of your eye, and you pause, rewind a bit, and check it out. And yes, it was what you thought it was. Even those tiny little things they managed to get in here.I get it, many people whining because it didn't follow the games and such. For me that's a bonus. That's what I would want. Otherwise I'm simply seeing something I've already played through countless times and know like the back of my hand.No, this is fresh, but it follows the natural flow of what I would expect in this post apocalyptic world. It is the world I've come to love over years and years of gaming, through totally new eyes that caught everything.Actors seem to be doing just fine so far, and they are introducing them and letting the viewer get to know them in bits and pieces as the story grows.Normally with an adaptation like this, I can find something that bugs me. I've been bug free so far, this is simply a purely enjoyable ride, with amazing humor (I don't know how many times I've laughed out loud at something that was just so unexpected but was EXACTLY what you'd expect from the world, if you follow that twisted phrasing). It's dark, it has plenty of unexpected moments, and it is absolutely, 100% enjoyable. Everyone involved should be very proud of the product they've made.",10
True to the games: funny and gory. From a game fan.,"Fallout the TV show is a terrific adaptation of the the Fallout game world and story. It introduces an entirely new storyline like most of the games did, and it stays true to the style of the original games. After the utter disappointment of Halo and the mediocre stock of The last of us; this show is a real delight. Gory, well paced and well written with the right amount of humour. Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins really shine in their portrayals of the Vault Dweller and the Ghoul respectively. I cannot recommend this show enough to both the Fallout fans and newcomers alike. 10/10 for me. Well done.",10
Knocked it out of Diamond city ball park!,"I've waited years for this, as a huge fallout fan and they certainly didn't disappoint. There was only one spot where I was thinking it had wishy washy cgi and I'm sure everyone will agree that otherwise it's fantastic. The story was strong and engaging, the characters were super entertaining and had depth. If you're a fallout fan there is tons to look at and be reminded of the games you grew up on and love. I honestly don't know how I can do anything other than praise them for making a show that added to the world instead of doing it damage. I look forward to seeing what they come up with next. Kudos to everyone who worked on this. The actors were incredible!",10
"Balancing humor, horror, violence and social commentary","Based on Ep 1I'm a fallout fan, so that probably make me biased. Although, the harshest critics so far seem to be fallout fans.The quality and attention to detail is astounding. It feels like the game has come alive but does not feel fake. It balances sci-fi, humour, horror, violence, and social commentary with ease.The first episode was slower than I was expecting, but this showed a confidence in story-telling and world building. Happy to keep watching and see where the story goes.Lots of little details for fans of the game, the blink, or you'll miss appearance of a junk gun being a great example. I had to pause, and yes they'd faithful replicated that odd weapon.",9
Food For Junk-Thought,"I don't play video games, so the trailer had me expecting an dystopian thriller with a satirical edge, perhaps along the lines of Robocop. And the sheer number of 10/10 reviews, right here, calling it ""phenomenal,"" ""clever"", ""mind-blowing,"" etc., sure had me stoked...I was not expecting slapstick.Be warned: Fallout is the ""Dumb & Dumber"" of apocalyptic series. In fact, that's far too kind. Fallout is the ""Dumb & Dumber To"" of apocalyptic series. It is all gags, relentlessly, and about 1 in 9 land.The characters use bottle-caps for currency, love Jell-o cake, enjoy having their codpieces polished, and sometimes have great-uncles who are amphibians.""Clever,"" remember.The attempts at satire are so nonstop, the jokes so never-ending, that it makes Rick & Morty feels like a drama. I'm not being hyperbolic. Episode 1 of Fallout starts out like a thriller with layers of dark comedy, but ""thriller"" and ""dark"" are dropped entirely by Episode Two. It's just zany, goofy low-stakes gore and potty humor after that.""You had your finger hacked off?"" Asks a crazed robot-doctor. ""There! I've given you a brand new finger! Now I'm going to harvest your organs!"" (That scene actually happens.)I do enjoy idiotic TV, as much as the next guy... I just prefer to know what I'm buying into, ahead of time. This show is complete idiocy, by design, and that's fine... My review is only to warn you that this is nothing in the vein of, say, The Last Of Us or Silo. There is no drama, there is no darkness, and there are no thrills to be had.Just jokes. One after the other. Infinitely.On the technical side: A major fight between an Iron Man and a zombie gunslinger, in Episode Two, is filmed with the skill of Godzilla vs. Megalon. (By the lesser of the Nolan Brothers, apparently). If they were aiming for Monty Python, I guess they nailed it.So, 4 stars, since this is probably intended for people who laugh at farts, and they're obviously thrilled about it.",4
The accuracy is unbelievable!,"They must have had a blast making this series. Can you imagine, after years of designing the games, you get to see it all come to life?! To walk through the sets and see all the details. As an artist myself, I would have loved to have been a part of this. So awesome!Big fan. Can you tell?! Have played the games, multiple times, and I am beyond thrilled with this series. And Walter Goggins?! Come on! So great!Just thinking on all the games and all the locations, this series could go on and on and never get old. Each season could be a new location and new storyline.I've been so disappointed in most of the game adaptations but not this time.",10
Great series! Exactly like a game,"The Fallout TV series brings the popular video game to life with a thrilling and true-to-game world. The show features detailed settings of the game, interesting new characters, story and plenty of action. It mixes tough choices with humor just like the game. Fans of Fallout games and new viewers will find a lot to enjoy, and hopefully looking forward to a potential second season.Anyway, very recommend to watch!I'm pretty sure after watching you will want to Fallout games again.And hope the Bethesda Softworks will develop next generation game even with more extended features, more advanced graphics and gameplay.",10
Masterpiece,"Some time ago I've played Fallout 4 a lot. And I have to say that this TV series is really well put together. They picked the right cast. The acting is top notch. The scenery is made like it's so real and makes me feel that I'm truly there. (Yes, I'm also fantasizing about it. Is that wrong?) What about the timing for this to come out in these serious world threats? Makes it even more real. The story is good but it's not something we haven't seen before. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a fanboy. Even my uncle who never played a Fallout game strongly likes this series. So gamer or no gamer. This is made for everyone who likes this genre. So far these episodes are really enjoyable and I hope they will continue to be like this or even surpass this level of entertainment. If there is a gamer out there who played a Fallout game and who complains about this TV series, that gamer is just plain nuts.",10
Amazing Piece Indeed - But...,"I really loved the work they have put in. The script, quality of costumes and CGI are top notch when you consider it is especially a TV Series.They are mostly loyal to the series.My critiques are :In the video game series, China really attacked the US (not the companies that bombed themselves in order to win massive money), but this turn is also interesting. That is quite fine.Brother of Steel's power armour, like T-60, WOULD NOT get destroyed so easily.Though the ""Ghoul"" character looks interesting as a sharp shooter and cowboy, he would have no chance against Power armour, so that was a bit cheese, and Ghouls are not bulletproof after all.I do not understand why the main character and the guy from BoS (Brother of Steel) do not loot at all. They would eventually die without any guns (Considering how hazardous and dangerous the environment was in the games.)NCR Ranger Helmets are ONLY used by Rangers, not Farmers. And they were not used by public but by Elite soldiers, indeed. I did not like that nerf/reduction of the reputation of those guys. But probably from the ending, we will be seeing a Fallout New Vegas type road for the script, I believe.Expected Super Mutants to Happen in Shelter 4 (But I guess because of the budget, they had to use the monster/creature from the sea.)When Shelter company and other companies were discussing the possibilities when they dropped a Nuke and the life afterwards (Like ""imagine the super mutants""), it was a comical joke since the life was good before Nukes and they would not expect people to become Super Mutants due to Radiation. So it is not consistent.Expected Enclave to interfere, to be honest. The scientist who had escaped so flawlessly, but they did not act somehow. In the series, Enclave and BOS are enemies, and they did fight each other.People were so clean, but in the game considering how restrictive to reach to clean water, people were in dirt mostly.Most people were savages due to the difficulty the effects of the atomic bomb brought.There were chickens and cows (which should have mutated)Also lots of greenery but we all know that it should have been mostly dried out trees or desert. (It was also a bit odd to see them in Fallout 4) because it almost is basically impossible after the nuke.I think those are the only flaws; the rest were amazing indeed. They really nailed it! (Amazing acting and CGI, Costumes and environment indeed.)",9
I've never played the game.,"Unlike most of the reviewers, I never played any of the fallout games. I'm aware of them and know the basic premise but have no deep understanding of the lore. I feel like that may have made it more enjoyable for me, kinda like when you haven't read a book a movie is based off, you have nothing to compare it to. The show was great, very entertaining, good acting, good writing, excellent CGI and the pacing was perfect. They did a good job at building a foundation for the world and it's warring factions. Would highly recommend to someone who knows very little about the game. I'm looking forward to the coming seasons.",9
The era of well-done adaptations continues...,"Honestly, even from the trailer, there is hope this adaptation won't totally suck. And boy did it deliver. The world building, the moral dilemmas, the companions, and the set and costume designs, damn! This is one of the most faithful adaptations to a video game IP I've seen yet. The post-apocalyptic landscape looks fantastic with a ton of familiar locations, characters, music, and the story? It keeps you engaged as it slowly unravels the main conspiracy.This is a love letter to the franchise and is one of the best video game adaptations, if not the best, I've seen yet. Not only was it able to keep the vibe, the feel, and the aesthetic of the series perfectly intact, it managed to create a cohesive plot with multiple perspectives. The essence of Fallout has a satirical lens to it. The world is incredibly violent and dangerous, but the inhabitants all deal with it differently, some often with a morbid sense of humor. There are plenty of moral choices to make, and even though you don't get to make them yourself, you get to see different perspectives and how each character makes the choice based on their own unique experiences.Let's go back to the character and set designs because the show absolutely nailed it. The vaults had its retro aesthetic with a distinct futuristic look, the first town was filled with garbage, goons, and makeshift shops, the Brotherhood of Steel had its iconic power armor and advanced weaponry, the ghouls with its fantastic makeup design, and the absolute carnage and impact of various weapons. The show managed to capture the style so remarkably consistent across many different locations and factions.When the production is this faithful to the source material, it's hard to find any flaws because the positives overwhelmingly shadow the negatives. You could argue certain characters are not your cup of tea, but they still act cohesively based on their past experiences. You could argue someone who hasn't played the video games might be left a bit confused or miss out on the familiar locations, but the show does a great job showing you the lore by switching between the past and the present. You can even argue the plot relies too much on being at the right place at the right time, but that is always a flaw when you have a world this massive while following multiple characters.All in all, this was an awesome adaptation which definitely got me revisiting the games again (much like how Cyberpunk Edgerunners got me to finally play the game). There are more stories to tell, enemies to fight, and locations to see. We will see what happens next!",10
"WOW, This is Great Classic Sci-Fi.","Not a gamer, don't care how this compares. Blah Blah.However, for over 5 decades I have been a fan of Sci-Fi, Movies, Books, Short stories and Television. This show is a wonderful progression of what classic Sci-Fi is all about. It is beautiful to look at. The casting/acting is stellar. The story is interesting, and keeps you thinking. Like all good Sci-Fi it also says something about human nature. Lastly, even though it has amazing effects the viewer is not over whelmed with all types of chaos and nonsense (see the last few avenger movies) on the screen. This is very story/actor driven and the effects and simulated 1950s supertech is such a wonderful visual feature.Watch this it one of the best shows I have seen in a while.",9
The Typical Insertions and Retcons the Games,"The Fallout setting is supposed to be a somewhat tongue in cheek 1950s America that just never ended, so well up to the date of the nuclear war in 2077, appliances, cars, homes, clothing, etc. Are like they have been stuck in time for 120 years. The 1950s music is still there, as is the Mom and Pop culture.The intent is to ironically contrast that saccharine existence with the harshness of the apocalypse that arrives.Well ... this series kind of tanks that. The casting is like a commercial for Benneton or a UN diversity program and not 1950s America. None of the hair styles fit. None of the accents fit. None of the word choices fit. It's like the series just ran over to the nearest mall, found a bunch of kids and their parents, and asked them to pretend to be in the Fallout setting. Even the humour is typically straight from the Millennial handbag, with a ton of sarcasm and double entendres.This incongruity with the setting continues with the casting, where Brotherhood of Steel recruits (called Aspirants), some of whom have been training with the Brotherhood as foot soldiers for most of their childhood, look like they haven't done a push up in their lives. They don't look like recruits with years of physical training, they look like their only battles were with controllers in their hands. The notable use of a waifish, almost skeletal actor to play the 'best' Aspirant in the pile, the one chosen for promotion, when that actor looks like they would struggle breaking bread or holding a coffee for any extended length of time is a good example. They clearly cared more about that person's demographic makeup than they did whether they actually looked like what the role demanded.The main character from the vault is effectively a Mary Sue. In the first episode, she spouts her vault resume to convince the leadership of the vault that she's a good candidate for marriage to a man in another vault, something they do to help the bloodlines. She's literally good at everything she does, from hand to hand, to shooting, to science, to people, to bravery, to intelligence ... her only flaw is being naive, and that gets cured out of her quick, so her one real flaw is more or less gone by the end of the first episode.There's a lot of nods to items, people and places in the game, but this is where it gets messy. The absolute and utter retcon of the lore in at least four of the games by this series is, well, unforgivable. An entire faction, probably the most positive and interesting one, is completely wiped off the Earth. It just doesn't exist.I watched long enough to learn that, and then shut it off. It was OK, and moderately entertaining to that point, with the caveats listed above, but if you want me to swallow your casting nonsense and utter disregard for the setting at the same time, that's just not going to happen.I've given it four stars out of deference to the games, but this show isn't really all that good at all. There's a lot of fans who will clearly vote it up because Dogmeat is in it, or the Junk Jet, or a cool cowboy ghoul, but the core jobs of making a compelling story, the writing, the casting, and the sets only see one stand out (the sets). You really need all three.The retcon, though? Unforgiveable. The show runner should honestly be ashamed, after saying time and time again that his show was canon. That was 100% a lie.",4
Amazon Strikes Gold Again,"I don't really write many reviews but Fallout blew me away. I wasn't sure how well it could be adapted since the main character in the games is whoever you want them to be but this was amazing.Along with The Boys, Invincible, Reacher and now Fallout Amazon is the best streaming service for TV shows anything they touch seems to turn to gold. Whether your a fan of the games or not you'll enjoy the show. It perfectly captures the feel of the world of Fallout. Like the game the show also ignores the 'main quest' for all the 'side quests' and that's when its at its best.Walton Goggins and Ella Purnell steal the show as The Ghoul and Lucy you can really tell they are enjoying what they are doing. The action is really well done, its extremely violent and gory like the games. I also like how they logically managed to incorporate stimpaks(the game's way of healing) into the show it was really well done. I can't wait to see what they do with season 2.",9
Apocalyptic Brilliance,"Fallout masterfully translates the beloved post-apocalyptic universe of the game into a riveting television spectacle. Set against the backdrop of a nuclear ravaged world, the series not only captures the grim aesthetics and expansive lore fans adore but elevates it with a deep narrative and complex characters.Every episode is a meticulously crafted piece of art. The directors and writers have gone to great lengths to remain faithful to the original material while injecting fresh, innovative storylines and character arcs that expand the franchise's mythology. The result is a richly layered world, filled with morally ambiguous choices, intense drama, and a constant, underlying threat that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.The casting is a triumph, with each actor embodying their character's essence perfectly, bringing to life the series' iconic figures with vigor and authenticity. The standout performances are complemented by uncompromising production values, from the hauntingly beautiful cinematography and detailed set designs to the atmospheric score of the game itself bringing tension and emotion to the wasteland.Fallout is not just a series.. it's an immersive experience. The creators have achieved a delicate balance of action, suspense, and storytelling that hooks you from the first scene and doesn't let go. Whether you're a longtime fan of the games or a newcomer to the universe, the series offers something for everyone-a testament to its universal appeal and craftsmanship.It is a masterclass in adaptation, a series that not only meets the high expectations of its source material but surpasses them. It stands as a beacon of how to bring video game narratives to the screen, and with the Westworld creator at the helm I can't wait to see how the next season pushes the boundaries even further and deepen the already rich tapestry of this world.",10
Almost,"The story here, is not only pretty fantastic, but it seems to be serving as an over-arking narative, linking together every game. As opposed to watering down the importance of the individual stories of each game, this adds texture and depth that I didn't realise was missing, despite the thousands of hours spent, captivated of the sandbox worlds and immersive gaming experiences of multiple titles. If this is going to be the model for the TV series overall, it's quite genius.There are some areas I feel that could have used more detail however.When you play the games, as important as the stories are, the vast majority of game play is traversing a perilous wasteland, where hazards are almost frequently upon the player. At times we see a character in an area, when we return, we see that they have arrived at a new area. More detail battling, or escaping, any of the many irradiated fauna, or array of unsavory factions, rather than simply arriving, would have made this closer to the gaming experience. Or even, perhaps running into a friendly faction, as the Wanderer works for multiple factions, be that either of the lead characters, or both.Also, it would have been nice to see workstations in use, when the were opportunities to do so, as they are integral to games.These additions would have made a near perfect game adaptation, which we will undoubtedly see more of with the recent successes.The attention to detail elsewhere was imbecile.This could well be in the running for at least nominations at next year's awards run.",9
This show probably the best in 2024!!,"This show is soo good, I think that they would win some acting awards, I loved Walton Goggings acting definitely in him as Cooper Howard's flashbacks, Ghoul is definitely my favorite, loved they show three different POV's, love how they reveals it all. Definitely getting a S2. I think that Cooper Howard/The Ghoul definitely the main character of S1. Never seen a show has so much awesome cinematography and if you are very comfortable with violence this would be a good show for you. It's a lot of different storyline than the games and I think the con is that episode 5 and 7 is okay. But other stuff are great.",9
By far the only best adaptation to a game franchise,"You know... one thing I will never get... is the self-important attitude of fans. From all the many toxic features today's global media communication suffers from, one of the main source of the toxicity is the fanbase of any franchise ever. I am tired of people not having the ability to enjoy whatever they want to enjoy, I am tired of people not being able to have base-level healthy discussions about literally anything today, I am tired of studios taking advantages from catering fanbases with all kinds of honeypotting practices and the audience not having the minimal intelligence to see that and pull out their head from the bubble they live in. We may think they (the studios, creators) give any damn about distributing quality contents from their hands, to live up to any expectations set by high standards of a franchise, or to just simply make enjoyable products to the audience. As you may know for now, as a grown up, that it is always about the money, and nothing else, especially in later times.Warcraft: The Beginning? Not so bad, actually quite good for the effort, could have been better, and should have been continued. Prince of Persia? Not good, not bad, somewhere in between, forgettable. Mario bros? Never talk about it, ever. Mortal Kombat? Any of them? Not really, 1995 one for the nostalgia, still we are not talking about quality entertainment. Assassin's Creed? No. The Last of Us? Give me a break, episode 1 was probably the only good from the season, but overall disjointed and underdeveloped on the most important parts. Street Fighter? Same as for Mortal Kombat. Any Uwe Boll movies? Hell nah!Here comes the show Fallout based on one of my favorite franchises that I adore dearly simply because of its unique world-building I can't get from any other franchises; when the vault-boy appears on the screen of your pip-boy, smiling, gives you a thumbs up how great you are as a player in the middle of a bloody, gory, most brutal shootout/hack'n'slash combat against random raiders in the middle of the most depressing dystopian future while some up-beat oldie is playing on the radio giving you one of the most unique grotesque satire filled with dark-humor in its coolest forms.And you know what? The show simply did the impossible and giving you the vibe you would always expect from a Fallout story. The tone, dark yet humorous vibe, the absurdity, its randomness, the multi-layered philosophical questions on the works of humanity, society, group mentality, the evolution of different world-views with all-kinds of possibilities, the brutality, goriness, the depressing conclusions of high efforts with minimal payoffs.The overall substance of the show simply described looks like this; they put 10 individuals into a meeting room, asked every one of them to describe what Fallout means to them, collected the answers, poured them, mixed them together, and made a show based on that with high understanding of the franchise and movie-making in general. And thank god they asked the right people, had the right artists to execute these visions, because damn... it is written and acted overseer-damn good, audio-visually narrated on the highest level to ever achieve on a series.I am shocked honestly how good this turned out to be. Everyone was praising The Last of Us as something groundbreaking, and best adaptation to a game, but, come on, it wasn't that good at all, way off base. Especially compared to this.The right team, right people, at the right time, with the right visions, everything works amazingly here. God bless the team behind Fallout. And God bless America!",10
Season 1. A strong opening,"Yes. One of those rare shows that we picked up on the day of release. Watched it in a couple of days, enjoyed it thoroughly!Watching this reminded me a lot of Westworld.I haven't played the games - didn't know anything about them. But that doesn't matter, you don't need to know.I like the way Fallout plays history: action in, say 1958-1962, to 219 years into the future. It's clever and believable sci-fi. The imagery is strong and themed.The action is good - very good. I liked the storylines of the central characters which developed and delivered. The overarching stories are compelling. Good sci-fi. It's got its own sense of humour too!A weakness is that Fallout is a little predictable. Also, we see quite a lot of the vaults and vault dwellers, but we don't see enough of the other ""tribes"". Maybe season 2 will give us more?Overall - Fallout season 1 is a strong opening.",8
Have not seen all ATM...,"So is showgood enough for new to lore?Have not seen all ATM as a topic, but for 4 first episodes...
As an Old Fallout game player and I mean Fallout 1 and fallout 2 in late 1990's. This is truly tingeling all my gamer memories from the fallout one to four and vegas too. So many inside jokes and references to all game that just made me think... How someone who doesn't know anything about the game, feels of the show?Because I think show is a very good, but I do know that game lore.Hopefully people who haven't played the game, willl enjoy show as much as I. But I can understand if it's difficult to understand whitout playing games.",9
Meh,"I guess reviews for the show are written by die-hard fans. Or maybe people now ready to eat-up whatever content, they can get, that looks good. I mean it, the show does look great. It gets post-apocalyptic aesthetics to the T, and is filled with little details that are capable to tell a story of their own. In a game this would be a real achievement, and it was: even though I never got into Fallout series, I can admit, that it had high detalization of the world through-out. At least in the main series games, that I did try.But even for a game it's not enough: you need a good story, and good gameplay there, too. I never liked the gameplay part of the series, it just did not click with me unlike The Elder Scrolls, but TV shows don't need to bother with that. TV show creators' job is much easier then, right?In my opinion, these TV show creators fail at their job. I often complain about series, that have too much talking without using visual to tell the story. This one is the reverse: there is too little of talking, or at least of talking that would develop character, world of move plot along. Some reviewers did notice this as well, pointing out, that it feels like screenwriters were writing for a game, and for TV.If this was a short movie, this might have been fine, but for TV show - not so much. For me it was boring. Only the first part of the 1st episode was somewhat interesting to me. It was a cliche, but still a good starting point for a story: a sheltered society gets raided, and that forces a character (or characters) to go outside of that society and learn about the world. But then we switch to part of that outside world, and it's not as interesting.It's not just Brotherhood of Steel, but the outside world in general. The creators are trying too hard to make it look ""uncivilized"" or ""militaristic"" or ""sterile"" or just ""weird"", and as result it all feels forced. As if they had a list of things to show, and they progressed through the story by checking items off that list.At the least, I think they should have used just 1 main plotline with the girl leaving shelter. It could have become a travel-show with fish-out-of-the-water theme, and each episode could have explored all the weirdness of this strange world, while the girl was moving forward. You know, a bit like The 10th Kingdom back from 2000, but post-nuclear. Alas, we have what we have. As is, I would rather rewatch Silo. It was not a perfect show, but it was much more interesting to me.",4
This is what the standard should be,"First of all, huge fan of the Fallout series. I was worried that the show wasn't going to be all that. This is exactly how a show based off a video game should be made. This is the best tv/movie based off a video game yet. Last of Us was good, but this whole show has been phenomenal from start to end. The attention to detal is fantastic. Hats off to everyone involved in making this. My girlfriend has never played, and has never heard of Fallout. The show does a great job in captivating audiences that know nothing about the franchise.I love that they use music used in the games and for trailers for the games. I love everything about this show.",10
Finally a great adaption,"Really worried about this series. First of all I absolutely love the Games. And with all of the past rubbish attempts to adapt a game, I feared for this.But I didn't need to worry. Mr Nolan has done a fantastic job. The characters are great, the action is good, the settings are just as good as I hoped they would be, but under all that, and for all of those who have never played the games, there is a really good story. For those who know the games it brings it all to life, and for those that don't, it will show you why you should play the games.Ella Purnell is perfect as the nieve vault dweller that has never known the outside of her nice safe underground home that keeps them safe from the radioactive surface following nuclear apocalypse 200 years ago. But the need arrives to go outside and her world views and expectations are shattered and a superb journey and story begin.Fully recommend this and as I have an idea of what is coming for the next season, it is only going to get better as well.",10
An absolute blast,"When you take something long established and very well loved and adapt it for the screen it needs to be near perfect or those little imperfections start to grate on the fans of the original medium.I was so apprehensive when I heard they were making a Fallout tv show. Could they really capture those post apocalyptic visuals? Could they REALLY capture the humour that runs through this dark and deadly world. I mean REALLY?Apparently ""Yes"" is the resounding answer. Jaw dropping visuals and laugh out loud moments amongst all the flying gooey bits. It's an absolute blast and I loved every minute of it!",10
It's on the Mt Rushmore of SciFi TV,"Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Game of Thrones, Fallout...OK.... Dr. Who if we had 5 faces. The point is, it's that good. We all knew Walton Goggins was gonna what he does. Since The Shield we know he's been doing it, Every. Single. Time. How this man is not buried under the weight of multiple Oscars and Emmys is a question for all of Hollywood. What we did not see coming is Ella Purnell. Ella carushes it here as Lucy. With one lip snarl she conveys fear and confidence in the same, well, lip snarl. She goes from Okey Dokey newlywed to Okey Dokey survivalist to Okey Dokey stone cold killer. The Lucy McLean she portrays could successfully sell me everything from toothpaste and hair conditioner to armor piercing bullets to Santa Claus.Never played the game and do not give two F's to ever do so. This series is all it needs to be. The world building, character development, editing, music, props, wardrobe, everything are all fantastic.",9
Amazing,"I was sceptical at first as it is hard to capture gameplay on the TV, although this show was fantastic. You felt like you were immersed right into the world of fallout with some recognisable landmarks. The story is its own entity and doesn't follow any of the games story lines which in a way I love, it gives the writers the ability to have free reign and introduce new characters into the mix. The storyline was great, it kept me wanting more and I sadly binge watched it all. I'm hoping for a season 2 as this will be one of my highly anticipated watches. I recommend this show to anyone even if you aren't a fallout game player!",10
Exceeds Every Expectation,"I went into this highly skeptical. I played the games when I was younger, and I didn't want to watch an adaptation that would tarnish my memories of the wasteland. This series exceeded all my hopes and expectations. It reminded me why I love the universe of Fallout. There's something so charming about postwar optimism resonating amidst nuclear apocalypse.What they do well:
-They found the best actress to play their vaultee. She captures the look and idiosyncrasies of a 1950s cartoon character, and her enthusiastic ""Okie dokie!"" never fails to bring levity to an otherwise grim situation.-the series revives our favorite character from the game: dogmeat, a wasteland mutt who could single-handedly carry the show if he had to.-The music selection preserves those special feelings from games 3 and 4 where you're feeling like nothing-not even a swarm of radioactive roaches-can stand between you and your destiny.What people seem to dislike:
-Other reviewers complain that the tone is inconsistent, which seems a bit inflexible. Fallout is known for merging genres and maintaining a happy-go-lucky vault dwelling attitude amidst the grotesqueries of radiation and rampant violence. It's dark humor. It's not for everyone, but I don't see this as a fault in the writing/genre.-people complain that this world is inconsistent with the world of the videogame. I don't see this as an issue either as the creators are working in a different media entirely. I never expected this work to be ""canon"" with the game franchise's universe. It is a love letter to the game and its fanbase. I couldn't be happier with what they've given us.",10
Is Hollywood Finally Taking this Seriously?,"The history of video game adaptations in Hollywood is certainly dubious. Lazy productions and general disdain for the source material has led to decades of one of the world's most complex art forms being undervalued and underrepresented in film.But, with recent series like Fallout and The Last of Us, it seems like the tide may be shifting. It could have something to do with the video game industry surpassing all other entertainment sectors in revenue... by a huge margin.Whatever the reason is for this new renaissance of video game adaptations, I'm here for it.Fallout in particular, is an impressive showing of what can happen when filmmakers understand the source material. While The Last of Us is certainly a high-quality show with tremendous acting and a professional production, it very closely follows an existing story that has already been told with a world-class deftness in a different medium.All they really needed to do was follow the path already set for them.This is not the case with Fallout, which dares to be creative enough to give the fandom a brand-new story in the revered franchise. And it's good enough to go right into the head canon next to all the games. All of which I've played.The brutality of the wasteland, the comedic tone, the environmental story-telling, the cutesy juxtapositions against the harsh despair, the distinctive art style, and everything else ""Fallout"" is represented here with a true masterstroke of direction and set design.In particular, Lucy, our fish-out-of-water Vault-Dweller from Vault 33, and The Ghoul, our prewar cowboy-turned-Ghoul bounty-hunter, are story standouts. These two actors carry every scene on their backs like its effortless. I expected Walter Goggins to put in a good performance, as he always does.But, Ella Purnell was a surprise scene-stealer for me. I wasn't sold on her from the trailers, but her weirdness, her impeccable timing, and her wide-eyed naivety giving way to hints of darkness immediately ingratiated me to her character.I can no longer imagine anyone else as Lucy.What is perhaps even more impressive about the Fallout series is the cinematography, the props, and the set designs. The attention to detail to ensure this series fits into the lore with a proper respect is beyond commendable. It's legendary. A lot of money was spent to faithfully recreate the Wasteland, and it shows. If you've played the video game, I can't see how you'll be disappointed with this aspect of the show.Of course, it's not all perfect. But, what is?There are some pacing issues in episodes 2 and 3. Some of the comedy is very left-field and offbeat, which may turn-off some viewers. The Brotherhood storyline is also a bit of a missed opportunity, especially given the rich history of the organization. Plus, the monster CGI, featuring creatures like Radroaches and Gulpers, feels pretty B-grade in some areas.These minor grievances weren't enough to detract from the overall brilliance of the series.No, to the contrary, Fallout season 1 is a masterpiece. It's a testament to what can be achieved with an adaptation if the source material is given the proper veneration and admiration.Amazon Prime has a certified hit on their hands, and they have made a legion of fans very happy. Let's hope they keep this momentum heading into Season 2!While it isn't flawless, the Fallout series is about as perfect as can be with this kind of translation. I never thought it could be possible, but...It's a rare 10/10.",10
Missing something,"I was excited for the show to come out, though I had limited expectations. I've only played New Vegas and Fallout 4 (loved both).The show to me seems a bit...light hearted. One review called this the Disney version of Fallout and I think that's a perfect comparison. There wasn't much danger when traveling outside. And the people inside seemed like campy people from the 50s. Like a Leave it to Beaver cast.The show also bounced around far too much and I don't feel that that they handled that all too well. Often I had to ask myself ""did I miss something?""Two last points...there was ZERO explanation as to why Moldaver was still alive. She's a key character. Kinda feels like that should have been touched on. And at the beginning the raiders were radioactive but weren't scanned?",5
Solid start to what could be a promising series,"Just finished the series, and this is from the perspective of some one that grew up playing Fallout in the 90's that still has a metal Fallout poster on his wall.Overall, I thought it was pretty good. The series started with a bang, slowed down with some cheesy scenes (like the sentry system's mini gun completely missing for about 400 rounds, or the best mercenary in the west not being able to shoot a girl before an inexperienced man wearing power armour can tackle her to the ground), but it all came together in the end, with the last episode was easily a 9-9.5.The world and set designs were very well done - a lot of it true to the lore, even with little things like iguana on a stick, or junk items picked up in lockers in the game.That said, there were many times throughout, especially the early episodes where I thought it was a little too colorful and not gritty enough, almost ""Disneyfied"". They captured a lot of the gore/combat quirks, a good amount of the unruliness/ hopelessness, a lot of the Bethesda humour and a glimpse of the old school interplay/black isle twisted humour in certain scenes.At times it did feel a little a little too ""2024 with a pip boy"", with the studio checking off every box in the current hollywood trope checklist.Criticisms aside, I'd still suggest it as a good series to check out. As a purist there's a lot missing, but as a standalone TV show it's a solid watch, with a unique story set in the Fallout world.If you're on the fence, see it through, the ending episode negated nearly all of my complaints. Looking forward to season 2!",8
Really Hits the Nostalgia Button,The writers and directors of the show really get the essence of the fallout franchise. From the clueless and naivete vault dweller to the religious zealot of the brotherhood of steel. The use of the fallout music and vats system (limbs being shot off) give you a feel of playing the game. The creators bring a realism form video game to live TV. When watching the show I could not help but sing along which brings me back great memories of playing the games. The shows fun quirky humor has me rolling but also can have its serious moments having me on the edge of my seats wanting more. All and all the director and writes do a wonderful job and show is fun to watch.,10
A faithful addition to a lore heavy universe,"A lot of people I saw have complained about the contrast between the show and some of the game characters, and I think the most important thing to note is that this show is not an adaptation of any fallout game. The basic plot of the lead follows some of Fallout 3, the brotherhood follows a bit of Fallout 4, but I was delighted that they didn't risk messing any previous characters or plots up and instead chose their own addition.In terms of the fallout world, this show seems almost entirely emerged into it. The show runners worked closely with the game creators and it shows, so when people criticize the relevance to the game they are criticizing the game creators as well.The show isn't perfect, nor could it be. Nothing with as passionate as a fan base as fallout could fully satisfy the masses, but so far it has done an incredible job. I've heard talks of a season 2 either continuing these characters or becoming AHS anthology style, but either way I am as happy as I can be with a video game adaptation.",10
Watch it,"Im two episodes in, and im already obsessed! The story line is great, the acting is great, the videography is beautifully done. The music? Just like the game! While only being a fre episodes in, I still feel compelled to tell others to watch this immediately. This could also come from a selfish place, as I dont want them to cancel this show, and I want a second season (again, already in love this this) so, you all know what to do! Watch this, rate this, and then make a second, third, and even fourth season happen! Do it for the people. Do it for the surface dwellers. Do it for the vault dwellers. Do it for ME! Okay, that is all.",10
An excellent adaptation which stands on its own merits,"First, I don't consider myself a gamer and my only prior experience with this franchise is from having played a bit of Fallout Shelter, a very basic and simple spin-off on mobile. My partner has played several of the real Fallout games.But much like The Last Of Us, this series stands on its own without any familiarity or investment in the video games. The characters are complex and well-developed, and the world building is absolutely astounding. Any fan of sci-fi, nuclear apocalypses, and/or dystopias will probably have a lot of fun with it. And unlike The Last of Us, Fallout is filled to the brim with morbid and edgy humor along with a generous helping of kitsch.The primary setting is the American wastelands hundreds of years after a nuclear apocalypse which occurred in a futuristic ""atompunk"" 1950's. That earlier era is also featured in numerous flashbacks as more is revealed about Vault-tec, the enigmatic corporation which created the vaults still occupied by the descendants of the original inhabitants.In that wasteland setting, the main characters are introduced and eventually intersect (sometimes repeatedly) with each other, as they all desperately chase the same valuable object for very different reasons, and with none of them even knowing why it's valuable.",10
Pleasantly Surprised,"I'll start it by saying I am a fan of the games, and when I first saw the trailer I had my doubts. Many current day live adaptions have been abysmal in the last few years (Rings of Power, The Witcher, Resident Evil. However this show finally breaks that mold.The show is good. The main character Lucy actually undergoes a decent character arc. She is over trusting and kind to fault, something you can't be in the hostile Wasteland. However when she does try to take matters in her own hands, it can equally drastically backfire causing her to constantly doubt what is the right thing to do. She is in no way a Mary Sue. She gets bruised, bloodied, stabbed, captured and again clearly is very naive as to how the world should work with dramatic consequences to her actions.The world of Fallout looks amazing. From the designs of the retro style cozy vaults to desolate, irradiated Wasteland, it very much captures the feel of the games. The creatures also look great. The irritated monsters are terrifying, be they ghouls, radroaches, or giant abominations. There are also plenty of Easter eggs or winks to games for those who have played them. And I personally loved how the story was split between the past of how the Vaults came to exist/history of Vault tech just before the Great War and then current day survivors in the post apocalyptic Wasteland.Is the show perfect? No which is why it's not a 10. But it's not bad either. Again as someone who played the games I really enjoyed this series. I really don't understand the negativity because this is leaps and bounds better that Netflix's treatment of the Witcher or what Rings of Power did to LotR. But hey, not everything is for everybody.",8
One episode in. Will edit if need be,"So, like the title says, I am 1 episode in. I have played 3,4, and new Vegas. So I know the lore and design and overall gameplay. With all that said, I don't see any reason this show is below a 9 after 1 episode. Yeah we got box checking roles and yeah we got unnecessary sex and yeah we got a character that doesn't make sense in regards to the game. But other than that, it all looks great. Between the nuka cola machine and the sugar bombs to grognak and pipboys, I'm liking it. Even a raider shot jet (or was it psycho?) in this episode. That's about as close as you can get showing a character shoot drugs from the game onscreen. Nonstop homage to the games.Yes, like I menationed earlier, the above ones I mentioned are lows for the show. And yes I see others say the steel armor looks fake. I agree in a way. But I need to see it used in combat and how it's portrayed before I make a decision. It looks pretty close to fallout 4s armor. I seen someone mention new Vegas. Not seeing anything like that here. Actually the NCR and the Legion would be great to have on a big screen, sprinkling in BoS and enclave(there's a Easter egg in the game) I just don't get the low reviews from so called ""gamers"" of this. Unless it completely changes, I think it's ok. Give me a deathclaw and a mirelurk and some energy weapons and ok. Throw in some radiation and boomskies.*1st edit. Starting episode 4. I'm not sure what creature that was in 3 but it wasn't anything like a mirelurk unless it was a mirelurk king. Maybe a made up one. Not sure. No idea how it died either. Maybe the human was poison? Idk I'm dropping a point for that and no weapons being used really. Where was the laser gun and that giant rifle squire was given in the bag?2nd edit- 2 episodes left for season 1 and we get an NCR power armor spotting. So this is supposedly somewhat in new Vegas territory. Cool. No change in rating.Final edit- so the ""mirelurk"" I called it is an enemy from fallout 76 called a grouper (I think). Ahh. Started that game couple weeks ago and haven't made it that far to kill one yet. Season 1 is basically an intro to the fallout game series, which I don't mind. It's good to get the non game players caught up on the design and plot. The problem with this is there's little action and little enemies/characters we see. We get a lot of fallout lore between nuka cola, robco, dogmeat, etc... but very few enemies. Maybe saving the budget for season 2? Idk but we need ghouls, super mutants, raiders, rad scorpions etc... we got none of that in season 1 and those enemies are in all the games. Staples. Least the recent platform ones. 8 is a valid rating.",8
Really?,"So you take the vast imaginative world of fallout, you take whatever billions of dollars of budget, practically any actor or actress you want out there... and you come up with this? It's so bad it's shameful. Cardboard conversations, acting so dull it killed any interest I had and I forced myself to see through the edit of predictable scenes that is the first episode. If it wasnt for the sex and violence I would've thought that this was aimed at children. Fallout is cheesy and fun, this is like a sitcom with laugh track. Everything is so over explained, obvious, the cringe I get from thinking that someone put thought (barely), effort and money into this hurts me after a while of watching. Such a waste. 20 minutes of bad slow mo fight scene with cute music is not doing it for me anymore, not after seeing it for the 300th time. Nolan listed cliches in this series. And also, the main character, who did the casting? Someones intern nephew? I find it hard to believe that someone so bad at acting is the star of this show when there are so many talented people out there.",1
"Great, but could have been better","I've been playing the fallout series since I was 12, I've never been too much into it, but enough to know lore. The series has been great, yes it was a little confusing until everything locked into place, but I couldn't stand the sexual scenes, yes fallout does hint to stuff like that but it's not pornagraphic like some of those scenes were, there is never full nudity in the games either unless you get mods for it. I wish that it was more like the games and would have faded with the sexual scenes instead of full on show them. No the show wasn't perfect but it was never going to be. And the people complaining about them basically ruining New Vegas, it doesn't, the story line is lore accurate and is supposed to take place after New Vegas, I'm not too sure how long after, but it is. It would be worth watching over and over again if there was either no full on sex scenes or you could be allowed to skip them. I thought the show was great but it really could have done without all the sexual stuff and full on nudity. I hope the next season has less nudity than what it had. Great plot line. I wish that it would have had more feral ghouls, there wasn't really any hordes of ghouls like there are in the games. Hopefully better and more things will be in store for the next season.",9
"Overall great, but a little slow at times","Overall the show is great and at the end we are left wanting more, but I feel the show started very strong, then several episodes were just kind of mediocre, then the last 2 were really good. I am definitely looking forward to the next season. The visuals are fantastic, the plot is pretty darn good (albeit slightly messy) and the actors are top notch! Walton Goggins is just absolutely amazing and we wouldn't expect any less of him. There are some cool innovative quirky aspects to the show that make it unique. Also they don't hold back on the violence and gore at all. Give it a shot and stick with it! The end is worth it.",9
So happy to be alive during A+ video game adaptation,"I'm an avid player of both Fallout and The Last Of Us, and so far, both adaptations have been done right, to say the least.Both series have nailed the environment, the feel, and the important narratives involved in the games.Fallout is stunning, reminiscent, and a treat for gamers with the references to the Vault, the Wastelands, COGSWORTH (my favorite), Pip-Boys, Nuka Cola, and so much more.Action sequences are choreographed with incredible details and the costumes are perfection.Also, the casting was surprising in the best way. Matt Berry as Cogsworth is a slam-dunk.Bethesda and Naughty Dog, keep it coming.",10
AMAZING,"Fallout as a show is something I have been waiting for. And now that it is here ITS AMAZING. I totally thought this would be a flop. But they nailed it!. They made the show just as the game, a colourful environment with much brutality and it's just like the game. The first episode got me hooked.Story wise I enjoy it, while it is another concept we still got characters and I am just amazed with how the brotherhood of steel is portrayed JUST RIGHT.On to the acting, and the feeling. In just 30 minutes of the first episode they make you feel tied to the characters and I don't want to spoil but the first 30 minutes got me feeling emotional.This show is amazing.",10
Legendary,"Ok so I am a Fallout fan boy and I have played the games since the first one came out and I was very excited about these series ofc I kept my hopes low but oohhh my goodness i was in for a surprise. This show really captured the essence of the game and truly it did a great job. Actors were fantastic, the script was superp and the cinematic visualization was phenomenal. I give this serie 10 out of 10 stars.The Ghoul and Lucy are characters i will not forget as the actors did really good job and stayed true to the games.Also all other characters really did seem they were just picked up out from random Fallout game down to every little aspect.Great story. Great actors. Beautiful FXThanks for the best show i have seen in years10/10.",10
I want to watch and play too!,"Having played all of the Fallout games, I found myself wanting to participate in the show. Explore, collect, shoot stuff. Watching was great, good stories, seeing all the paraphernalia and familiar items. Wish there was a way to interact with the show. Maybe they will come up with an expansion pack that follows the show's storyline. Acting is great, costumes are great, backgrounds are great. It was different to see what would have been NPCs being acted out by real people. I kept looking for Easter Eggs. I'm guessing there were some, but I didn't see any. Looking forward to more episodes and other shows based on video games. Skyrim next???",9
It's fallout with depth.,"Really good and respects source material.Insightful commentary on human nature. Episode six/seven was particularly good with its prewar depiction of the fallout universe and the society norms and governing powers. The lore around the corporations involved in vault-tec was exactly as you would imagine.One thing is for sure you will need to play the games again after this. Usually TV shows based on games takes you further away from your imagination with a game but this show has made me feel even more immersed.Also shout-out to props and detail in every episode, it just feels like it was all put together by people who really love fallout.This show is a winner.",10
I honestly thought this was terrible,"So the problem with the reviews is that almost all are people who played the video game. I did not and watched this as a stand alone series. It was so lame...such a cool idea as a story but had no substance at all. If you want to watch an underground bunker story, I recommend Cloverfield Lane.I literally turned it off after 16 minutes, so maybe I didn't give it a chance. But the acting sucked, the CGI was horrible. Why are they wearing matching suits anyway? And why are so many games being made into movies EXCEPT The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time? Which is definitely the best game of all time :)Give it a go if you are not a gamer, be forewarned this is a little lame.Edit: I got through 1.5 episodes. I thought all this hype surely meant it would be good. I would rather watch paint dry. Why anyone rates this above a 2, is beyond me. This show is absolutely awful in my personal opinion.",1
Spot on!,"When i first heard they were going to do a tv-series adaptation of one of my favorite computer games i was very excited! But also a bit unsure if they would manage to pull it off. Its such a big undertaking since The Fallout games and the universe where they take place is a culture in it self. Turns out i didnt need to worry cuz they've done a tremendous work! The attention to details in the Fallout-world is spot on! Everything is there; the architecture, the quirky music, the scenery, the strange food, the monsters! You name it! :D Im enjoying every minute of it!At the time of writing im halfway trough the season so i've no idea how it ends; but regardless, im already hoping for a season 2! ;D I want to see more of this!",9
THIS IS FALLOUT!!,"This show nailed fallout in every bit, the vault , the dwellers , the wasteland, and the show started as you might start any fallout game, a pre war intro, skip 200 years, vault dwellers, then the protagonist goes out to the open world to look for good old dad, AGAIN!! LOL.I doubted the power armors were going to look stupid, but it was done perfectly, even the ghoul guy looked amazing, and I loved the addition of the classic music, this is the trademark for fallout generally.Maximus represents all fallout fans once you get into the power armor, best feeling ever!!Waiting for season 2 already.",9
SPECIAL GOAT,"This is easily the best video game adaptation ever, but also a really fun show. Captures the essence of the fallout universe. The actors are great and the character development was a lot of fun to watch it unfold. Quirky characters and situations, I could see some of my play through styles in all of the main characters. The evil one, morally ambiguous and the saint.This show rekindled my love for fallout and I just reinstalled fallout 4 on my Xbox and am finally going to take on all the DLC content.Only one complaint is that some of the armour and guns looked a bit fake at times but what can you do?",10
Prime Nailed It,"Fallout should go done as one of the best, if not the best, game adaptions to screen. Binge-worthy confection that even those unfamiliar with the game should enjoy. The aesthetics are the future envisioned as if from a 1950's perspective.Goggins and Purnell shine in their respective roles, with Purnell bringing a surprising comedic naivete to her performance. Goggins is just perfection in what is essentially playing two characters (though same person).Fallout has some interesting cameos through the season. Prime went all out on this show. The production values are top notch, movie level. The humor is dark and well timed. But I'd say the best thing that Amazon did with Fallout is really capture the feel, atmosphere and spirit of the original game. I'm excited for more season and full expect there to be more.",10
Fan even without the game,"From everything I've heard & read, the show is pretty loyal to the game. Which i love! It's wonderful when a piece of media is true to the source material, it makes it even better for the fans who made it popular enough to become a show/movie. So cheers to yall!Now, as someone who never played the games and doesn't know a darn thing about it, this was a hell of a fun ride. I stayed up til 5am watching!l LOVE walton coggins casting, he is so perfect in everything he puts his name on! But i also enjoyed every single second of this show!! Im so glad i took a risk on something that isn't usually up my aisle <3 10/10.",10
Giving this show 1 star is genuinely sad,"This show is seriously awesome! It offers everything fallout is about. I grew up playing the games religiously and I couldn't be more happier with this adaptation it exceeded my expectations. For the ones who are giving it 1/10, that's insane you can watch something like this and leave that type of review. Sorry your predictions were wrong basement dwellers, yall don't need to try and bomb the ratings in spite!I hope to see many more seasons of this show and I can't wait to see what else Jonathan Nolan has lined up! Thank you Prime for a great adaptation on such an amazing video game and overall story!",10
PERFECT,"It is absolutely perfect!!!!!! As a lifelong Fallout fan this checked every single box and I could not ask for a better adaptation of the Fallout Universe on screen. Every single thing on this show is perfect, the writers really took the time to make sure they checked every box! From the vaults, to the wasteland to the PipBoys. They left no detail overlooked and that made this show amazing. Not to mention the actual plot line was fantastic! I could go on for days about that but the rest of the show was amazing! I could immerse myself in this universe and would not ask for anything better! I cannot wait for season two!",10
Watching someone play the game is more entertaining.,"Fallout is set in a clumsily put-together post-nuclear apocalypse world based on the computer game of the same name.While it boasts some impressive sets, the convoluted plot brings out mediocre at best from the actors who merely go through the motions of the drab storyline that is as bleak as the apocalyptic world itself.It appears that creating a TV series based on a popular computer game has become a common trend, similar to how computer games used to be developed from TV shows or movies. Honestly, they needn't have bothered; watching your kids playing the game over their shoulders is more entertaining. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the game, this is one to miss.",3
"Good show, but the last episode sucks hard.","I'm a big fan of the games and the show capture the essence of this world very well, but there are some elements that don't make any sense.The biggest problem is the last universe, i don't know if it's the writers politics opinion getting in the way or what, but i remember watching the first episode with a friend and trying to come up with the worst ending this show could have, just for laughs, and EVERYTHING that we said would be the most stupid thing ever, happened in the last episode.It's really dissapointing cause i was really enjoying everything before the whole thing is actually explained.",8
"Much better than expected, obviously 10 stars","I started watching the video game saga as a fan, I finished it as a fan of the film saga, SPECTACULAR, both for those who can understand the many quotes and for those who are approaching the world of Fallout for the first time without having ever heard of it speaking...
let's talk about what we see on stage: each episode seems like a film more than an episode of a TV series, formidable direction, spatial photography that gives the viewer that sense of wonder that only in fallout games a post-apocalyptic world can give, we cannot leave out the special effects that leave the viewer more and more surprised episode after episode... but what really moved me was the attention to detail, nothing was out of place, nothing was put at random, every object, character and directorial choice follows always a logical thread faithful to the narrative universe in which the events take place. In each episode we note the constant participation of the team of developers of the video game saga with whom it was possible to bring a perfect and healthy fan service while remaining true to themselves without distorting the product.Really well done, can't wait for the next seasons hoping there will be many more! 11/10!",10
Best video game adaptation with something for everyone,"If you have been a Fallout video game fan, you will more than likely love this show. They did a great job of bringing the game to life. The environments, the characters, the plot line, the music, and many other things I am sure I am forgetting, feel like they were pulled right out of the game.My wife also loved Fallout too, and she knows very little about the game other than the hours she did not see me while playing it. She said the story, the acting, the music, the set and costume design were all amazing.We both loved that they took the time to develop the characters in the beginning instead of jumping into the story. It gives a more emotional connection to the characters as the story develops.Overall, I would say this was very well done and cannot wait to see any upcoming seasons. If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it!",10
"Whether familiar with the Fallout World or not, this is a must-see","Have been a fan of the Fallout Universe since before it was even fallout. (It was ""influenced""/borrowed heavily from a game in the late 80s called ""Wasteland"".I am someone who loved the Lord of the Rings movies, and hated Rings of Power. Some movies respect the IP (intellectual property) they are based on, and some diredctors/writers/showrunners think they're smarter than the original author or the audience that made it popular in the first place.Well, all I can say is - NOT HERE. While introducing new characters, and a new part of the world, they catch the flavor of the Fallout post apocalyptic world in everything. Whether it's the Vault-tec themes, the actual music from the game, or literal flavor items like Cram (instead of Spam) or the deviled eggs.So, as a long-time fan, I am very, very well pleased.Now, the acting - absolutely love it. The main characters have heart, and go back and forth between human, and shock, a bit of gore to surprising kindness in this harsh world. I mean, what more needs be said about Walton Goggins? Of course, he's a scene stealer, but he's also unpredictable and you never know what he's going to pull. I'm very much reminded of his character Boyd Crowder in ""Justified"".I do have to admit, Aaron Moten's character is definitely giving me flashbacks from the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy where. John Boyega played something of a fish out of water/want to be neophyte good-guy type, though I have to admit, I like Moten's character a LOT better. (The writing is infinitely better, and I can't blame Boyega for the horrible writing he had to deal with!)And it'd be very unkind not to mention. Ella Purnell's Lucy who really is something of the face of the franchise. And, with those huge, lovely eyes of hers, one can understand why. But, her character is bright and inquisitive, and learns quickly from her mistakes. Somehow keeps her sense of humor, and yet, the writers and directors have shied away from the popular trend of making every female a mary sue, and instead having respected women by giving her room to grow - ditto all the main characters, honestly. Even three episodes in, it's plain to see.Secondary characters and story arcs aren't forgotten either. They REALLY give this world depth. Just b/c Lucy leaves the Vault, doesn't mean the audience does.TL;DR: The producers/actors/writers/directors have avoided the mistakes that beset so many productions these days: They take their time building up both the world, the sets, and the story, letting the characters develop and letting the audience learn about the world, right along with the characters.If they keep up this level of development, they surely deserve many seasons to come.",10
So much more than I expected...I hope they make more,"So I have played the game a bit. But mainly just loved the art and world building of Fallout since its inception.And when I heard Amazon was making a tv show...I had my doubts. Especially as hype and overhype grew. But man did this show deliver.It had some fan service but never detracted from the story. And the story was great. The acting was on point. I thought maybe it might be a little goofy or weird but man did they make it all work.It even had high emotional moments that I was not expecting nor was I prepared for.The formula used here could make so many other tv shows be greatly improved. Meaning, build a story, impactful characters that embodies what made the franchise great. But doing it in a manner that is original. The fact that my wife lik d it priced that the show built e great show that catered to more than just a gamer niche. And that is how shows need to be built.Based on my individual episode scores I had a lot of 9s, but collectively as a show. It's a 10. And I rarely rank anything a 10.",10
Anything a Fallout fan could ask for,"I wasn't expecting much from the series when I first saw the trailers but in short IT DELIVERED. It is a story that doesn't rely much on you knowing the lore and is a great introduction to the franchise. Great cinematography and direction, amazing acting, surprisingly good original music, great story and fan service. It is a mature series like others from Amazon and it doesn't shy away from showing some graphic content so it's up to par with the games. If you've played any of the games you'll feel right at home in this great series that has already set up season 2 with an amazing teaser that will get fans waiting for whenever the next season comes out. As a fan of the games and of good television I give it 9/10 (pretty biased).",9
"Surprise, it's actually good","With how The Witcher and other highly praised games have been televised into shows, I didn't have high hopes for Fallout... I haven't played the games but so many of my friends have, and everyone was afraid to get hyped up only to be let down. I saw the trailer and wasn't really that interested, but boy did that trailer not kiss and tell. After I got some hype recommendations from friends I decided to give Fallout a chance, and from episode 2 I was IN. The acting, the music, the props, the storytelling, the camera angles and details. It's just *chef's kiss*. The showrunners have managed to tell a story with humor and suspense and this amazing world has come to life in the most brilliant way. I take my hat off to everyone involved and can't wait for season 2.",10
Dumb and Meh,"Overall, up until.the 7th episode I was willing to ignore the flaws and holes and felt it was a decent 7 star show. Then the last episode and a half happens and I couldnt handle the stupidity of the writing and flaws.First the positives:
Aesthetic is great, really feels like an apocalyptic world.Walton Goggims is amazing. As the cowboy and the ghoul, he does an amazing job. His is also the best storyline and I wanted mote.Ella Purnell also put in a solid performance as Sarah especially when she was playing the innocent woman from the shelter. However the horrible writing in the last 2 episodes even wastes her.Now for the Bad:Maximus is a terrible character and the actor who plays him is terrible. Hated him and his storyline.Cringe Writing. If you can shut your brain off and not think about the plot, it can be quite enjoyable. I was able to do thus for 6 episodes but it was too much. Once you get to the end (last episode is by far the worst) and think about the rest of the series, it is a clown show. None of what happens makes any sense, their plans are stupid. Way too many coincidences and writing conveniences. Its a cast world yet characters continually run into each other. Certain storylines go nowhere.This show was not horrible but not good wither. A total mixed bag. The Horrific writing ultimately makes it unrecommendable by me. The shame is with a tighter plot and better writing, this could have been great. By the way, I have never played the games.",5
Above and beyond a game adaptation,"I am astonished at how the writers, producers, cast and crew brought this show to life. Not only do they portray and perfectly match the feeling of the game, but they have created an original story thats interesting, colorful, and executed meticulously to keep the audience interested.The story, acting, concepts, artistic direction, visuals and a persistence to creating something unique and interesting are all there. I will definitely watch this a second time, and I hope that there is a season 2. TV should always be this good!!!I am a Fallout fan, but I know that even if I never heard of the games, this would become one of my favourite shows of all time. A HUGE congratulations to the creators, you have proven to the world that game adaptations can be well made, if care is taken with the scripts, acting, staging, directing and producing. BRAVO to the whole team.",10
What a series!,"This was an unexpectedly good series and it certainly portrays the greedy and twisted human nature well, willing to sacrifice all kinds and the entire world for blind dreams. I really liked the Ghouls and the intrigue in the bunkers. The blind role of the brotherhood is as significant as the Inquisition. What the directors didn't consider is the fact that Malinois dogs, if they lose their owner or handler, lose their sense of purpose and don't join just anyone they meet. Everything else was well executed. Congratulations, and big ups! I'm eagerly awaiting the next part. 10/10 - a big massacre :)",10
"There is something strange , sweet and realistic about this show","Am not sure how to put it , its different from everything i have seen and at the same time it as some very familiar places. Although Stephen King is not related to this, it reminded me a lot of the black tower, the books, the way i saw it in my imagination. At the same time it is a very political series , far more political than the black tower and so true . We watch this very sci fi serie and we can relate to everything that is wrong in this world and with capitalist . In this after Apocalypse world the main characters are nor good our bad, they are all very different among them and loved to se the interconnection between such a variety of people and believes . It leaves you with a taste of sweetness and bitterness .",10
A Great Addition To The Fallout Sega,"As a long fan of the video game series , i truly respect and love this adaption of the series don't usually binge watch shows but i just had to with this and i am not dissapointed quite on the contrary , the characters are great each with own struggles in the world yet they all see through their differences and focus on the mission , fallout 3 fans will definetly enjoy the journey of Lucy and relate to how it starts and unfolds. Some episodes in the middle may be a slight drag at times but that quickly gets outshined by the lore , at this moment i recommend this show and await season 2 try it .",10
A fantastic ride!,"The people leaving negative reviews on this...good grief. You must hate everything. This show is fun, gory, hilarious and completely engaging.The characters are great, the settings immersive, and the storyline is compelling. I love that they gave a backstory to the Vault-TEC character. As someone who really enjoyed playing Fallout 4, this was a total treat, and if I may be so bold, probably the best video game adaptation to date.and that's coming from someone who really loved The Last of Us.Sit back, snack on some Cram and Sugar Bombs, pop the top on a Nuka Cola and enjoy this fun show.Bravo!!",10
"Disregard the ""1"" votes; try it","My three sons, now in their 20s, all played the game and all have watched the show and endorsed it.A baby boomer, I am on episode five and am thoroughly enjoying it. Perhaps my favorite part is watching Walter Goggins.There are a few weak points, like the guy who plays Maximus as others have said. He's not an especially good actor, nor is he a sympathetic character. The campiness is presented at face value, and the costumes, set design, soundtrack and overall direction are superb in my opinion.You don't have to be a fan of the game or even that aware of it - I watched it from time to time when my sons were playing - but if you are into sci-fi and good series with character arcs, give this show a try.",10
This is better than I could have ever anticipated,"This show is absolutely amazing, one of the best video game adaptations of all time, great story, great cast, great action scenes, it's actually funny and not annoying, the violence is incredible, you can tell they put some budget in there, the visuals are incredible, soundtrack is as any fallout soundtrack is: 🔥. Walton Goggins is great at his role, kinda reminds me of John Marston from Red Dead Redemption 1, if he was scorched by radiation. Having the creator of the games (most of them) Todd Howard himself as a producer was a great idea, they really did an amazing job bringing Fallout to the small screen. And also, to all those who put 1/10 and 2/10, 🖕",10
"Like the post-apocalypse scenery, there's not much there.","We made it through three episodes before giving up. The story was a simple quest that we have seen in various iterations a million times. It is just a gamer plot, which is fair enough considering the source, but it's boring, and the various plot holes are bigger than Santa Monica.Acting is generally fine, especially Walton Goggins (fantastic makeup-- it's the best part of the show), but they don't have that much to do. This plot, mediocre scripts, and humor that far more often than not falls flat.The cgi scenery of LA (the Theme Building at LAX, Randy's Donuts) is pretty spectacular, but the set pieces in various camps and towns is more often done on the cheap, and looks it.",5
A further expansion of the Fallout game Universe,"I never thought it possible that they could do a TV show based on the Fallout games but here we are.The show is set after all the games of which I have played them all. Id say this story is more of a cross between Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 and is closer to them two timelines.We follow Vault 33 which has yet to open and access the Wasteland of the United States, vault 33 is situated in LA which hasn't featured in the games before.Everything in the show is very familiar with the games and I instantly recognised the style and the colours, the settings and the music.After a really good opening in 2077 when disaster strikes we shift to the year 2296, over 200 years in the future and nearly 10 years after the finale of Fallout 4.Without giving much away Lucy from vault 33 is thrust out into the open on a quest yo find her father. We also follow a Soldier of the Brotherhood of steel, an initiate/scribe called Maximus as well as a Ghoul ( radiated human ) called Cooper Howard.There are other familiar sects and groups from the games who populate the world the tv show is set.The overall vibe of the show is Quirky but dystopian and violent, expect gore and blood and some mild sex scenes.The cinematography is excellent and this is a fast paced show that does not get bogged down in exposition nor melodrama yet the depth of the games is there. If you know the games you might not get all the details or history of prior events but the games were all seperate stories as well with very little character crossover and the TV show follows this ideology.Im not sure why there is some low reviews, maybe female and black leads is too much for some ??.Most reviews are good and I totally agree, its an 8 out of 10 could be a 9 even !!This is a good adaptation of the games and the games core setting.The violence and dystopian anarchic setting may put people off but within all of this is hope and human character.8.5/10.",8
Glad I ignored the bad reviews,"This show is beautiful, the design, the makeup and costumes. High attention to detail. I agree it doesn't accurately follow the Fallout game series, but who cares. They've taken a good concept and run in a different direction. The show taken on its own merits does not disappoint. I see a lot of comments discussing how the show isn't ""dark and gritty"" it doesn't need to be. We all know whst to expect from a post apocalyptic movie. In my opinion, this is more balanced and still suitably intense enough while maintaining a nice ease. I thoroughly enjoy the mix and varied perspective on the post apocalyptic world. Bring on more.",10
All good things to those who wait.,"As a fan of fallout games, I really enjoyed this television adaptation. Incredible set design, amazing cast, and story. The opening few minutes left me with chills. The background to the characters took a couple of episodes to develop, as with all good stories. A good balance for gamers and first time viewers, although there might be a few pauses to explain the relationships of the characters if you are watching with someone who has had no exposure to the game. As the episodes continued, the show became more with purpose and suspense. As for the people that refuse to watch another episode after the first one, I suggest if you want to dump on something, find a toilet. Looking forward to another season.",10
Absolutely superb,"I loved fallout 4. They really hit the spot with the whole fallout vibe going into the show... 50s music... violence but not too serious etc.... i loved the main character Lucy thought she was great, loved Coop ( the ghoul) he was immense... every episode i really enjoyed.... nostalgic for me but also unique and new and i just thought theyve done an amazing job id say its watchable even if you havnt played.... it is everything the last of us wasnt..... the plot was anything but predictable and left you guessing which is a rarity with all the predictable crap you mostly see nowadays... absolute smash hit in my eyes and i cant wait for the next season so fun to watch all round.",10
I'm OBSESSED,"I don't usually write reviews, but this show was just too incredible for me not to. I've never played the Fallout games, but that didn't really make a different in how enthralled I was. The show was so well done from the action to the comedic moments to the underlying plot that kept me (and still has me) on the edge of my seat.I've loved Ella Purnell after watching her Yellowjackets, and she killed it as Lucy. Walton Goggins had the most standout performance of the season to me though. He seamlessly played two characters and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't obsessed with the Ghoul.I'm now strongly considering playing the Fallout games, as I can't stop thinking about all the lore that lies behind such a massive game series. I've watched the show once, then watched some reactions to it, and I am definitely going to watch it again!",9
Fun series with dark undertones,"Pretty gory and gruesome, I loved that. Also liked that it began by showing the apocalyptic event that shaped this dystopian future. I haven't played the game, so I can't make comparisons to it. It seems like video game adaptations are becoming quite popular nowadays; Last of Us, Halo, and Twisted Metal. Good thing is you don't need to be familiar with the game.I love post-apocalyptic shows so this was right up my alley. I was almost always gonna like this. I like the type of futuristic it is, it's like the cartoon The Jetsons but dystopian. I always find it ironic how futuristic dystopias sometimes incorporate really old music from the 1940s into their soundtracks.This show is subtly, yet not-so-subtly, geared towards adults. Despite its lightheartedness, humor, and fun, it's easy to forget the gruesome aspects, like oh a decapitated head. It maintains a childlike happy vibe, largely due to the main character's naivety and optimism. She's like a ray of sunshine, too pure for the dystopian world she inhabits. Watching her character development as she learns the harsh realities is quite engaging. However, she remains fundamentally good throughoutAll the main characters are compelling. Maximus, despite his duality, is a fascinating character to follow. The ghoul, initially cool, adds emotional depth to the sci-fi drama and conspiracy through his backstory. Maximus' story also adds complexity. I do wish we could have seen more of the ghoul's adventures, but it seems like we'll get that in the next season. The first season mainly focuses on Lucy and Maximus.The premise of the show, revolving around a nuclear apocalypse and the conspiracies behind it, feels believable for a sci-fi setting. The contrast between the kind, loving nature of the vault and the violence and moral ambiguity on the surface provides an interesting balance. While I personally would've loved darker themes, the show's lighter tone isn't necessarily a flaw; it's just a matter of my personal preference. Overall, it's a fun series, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",8
Even my non-gaming wife loved it!,"As all of the other Fallout game fans have indicated, this series is an incredible recreation of everyting in the games - the characters, the 50's vibe, the music, the costumes, the props, the gritty ""survive at all costs"" nature of the wasteland contrasting with the safe and organized valuts.What impressed me most was that my wife who is not a gamer, doesn't like science fiction or historical settings and knew nothing about Fallout really enjoyed the series although the violence was a bit much at times. This says a lot about how well the characters, dialogue and plot were created and evolved through the series.Congratulations to Amazon on investing in this series and delivering on everyone's expectations.Can't wait for season 2!",10
Could be better,"I was so excited about this series, because Fallout games are familiar to me. Unfortunately, I am kinda disappointed. I don't feel the vibe of Fallout series, because everything seems like a comedy: colors, lights, characters, dialogues. We have lots of blood and violence at the beginning, but it's not enough to feel the postapocalyptic vibe. Characters are annoying (maybe except for The Ghoul, he's a badass and the only positive thing about this imo) and jokes are lowbrow. I don't complain about acting, because actors are really good. I only complain about poor script and lack of bitter, postapocalyptic world. Sadly, we got average comedy rather than Fallout.",5
I never was into gaming,"I have never been into gaming and I absolutely love this show!!! Bravo ""Fallout""!This is the type series you can lose yourself into.Has a fast pace , super special effects and a character development that is flawless.I'm in my mid 50's and I saw many of my favorite actors from other series I enjoy, Lost and Justified to name a couple so I was really thrilled to see how it was going to develop and wow was I happy I did.I seldom leave a review as they want you to write a small book to have it posted to ""IMDB"" but in this instance I felt that it deserved my time.If you're looking for a fun watch with great special effects then I would recommend this series hands down!I was drawn into it immediately after just 1 episode and it only got better episode after episode.",10
Good show! It's funny and unique Sci-Fi!,"Fallout TV show is surprisingly good - a genuinely fun and well told post apocalypse story that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's got tons of style and is actually very funny. Had me laughing out loud on a good few occasions.The story is jam packed with tons of great ideas, interesting sci-fi concepts and corporate / cold war politics. A variety of great characters and interesting factions. The sets and props and cinematography are fantastic! And of course the music is very charming and fun.So yeah all round a really fun, funny and enjoyable rendition of the Fallout video game universe. I really enjoyed series 1 and am looking forward to season 2. I hope the level of quality on display here continues! Give it a watch! :-)",8
Fallout games fan and I love this show.,"I have been playing Fallout since it started on PC and moved to consoles. I love this show! People complaining about bad writing either love to complain or have never played the games. The plot, and writing is just like the games. I had to restrain myself from grabbing my controller. I hope they do another season!!!! There are more easter eggs and nods to the games than I can count. It feels like the game, it looks like the game, and it sounds like the game. The show uses most of the music from the games plus some that fits very well. I found myself wanting more than the eight episodes we got.",10
Decent,As a fan of the games I think its great. I also think if your a fan of tv boxsets your in for a treat. It does have its flaws. It's post apocalyptic USA with green trees but who who cares. It's a good show with great characters. I was surprised how they handled Ella purnells character. She wasn't a girl boss like most shows do now. She was awesome as a vault dweller who used her initiative to survive. Like the game. Walton Goggins stole the show as the ghoul. The filli episode was awesome. The BOS was ok but I can't wait to see what series 2 brings. The vegas strip at the end made me want to start playing new vegas again. I thought it was great that the showrunners chose a completely different path to the game. Good effort and a solid start to a series I hope sticks around for a long time. Deathclaws are coming.,8
A Riveting Blast from the Past: Fallout Delivers a Stellar First Season,"The Fallout series triumphantly transitions from game console to television screen, masterfully retaining the essence of its source material while introducing an original, compelling storyline. The show's creators have woven a post-apocalyptic tapestry that is as vibrant as it is vast, with characters that are as deeply complex as they are endearing. Throughout the season, the narrative keeps you on the edge of your seat with its perfectly paced twists and the clever integration of Easter eggs that delight both newcomers and long-time fans of the video game.Each episode feels like a meticulous homage to the beloved franchise, yet it stands confidently on its own with a distinct voice and vision. The Fallout series is not just a nostalgic rehash but a fresh, bold exploration of a dystopian world. The cliffhangers and the suspenseful finale left me eagerly awaiting the next season. This show is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates rich storytelling and character development wrapped in a thrilling, speculative setting.",10
A shining light,"I wanted to say this series far exceeded my expectations though this statement may not be fair.When they announced this show I was annoyed as I could not picture a world where this show was anything but a terrible, low quality, poorly written cash grab. I loved the games, but gaming adaptations basically never work.Then the reviews started coming and they were positive, ""okay,"" I thought, ""it's probably still average, just not the trash everyone feared it would be.""But dammit it's actually amazing. The writing and tone are just perfect, the sets and costumes are incredible, the cast is awesome and the acting is great! Ella Purnell is especially just so so good.I'll say it, this is the best gaming adaptation, better than the last of us, whose cinematic game lent itself more easily to an adaptation. More than that it is the best show of the year so far.Big fan.",10
Fallout!!! I couldn't be happier.,"I don't do reviews. But being such a fan of the series since the original Fallout game, Tactics, BoS, all the way through to 76. The fact they are touching, or hinting at touching on one of the best in the series in the next season has so many fan waiting with anticipation.So many other game to series have failed, but I had to come on and say I love everything about this series. While it intriduces a few new elements, the nods to everything Fallout and even a live Vault Tec phone number is amazing. Characters were brilliant, casting was wonderful and with each episode I wanted more. I got it. Binged watched the entire season in a day it was so good.I am a fan to be certain, but that doesn't detract from the near perfect execution. Can't wait for more.",10
Dystopia for fourteen-year-olds.,"I am not a fan of this video game or any other. This is a dystopian fantasy series and I am a sci-fi consumer. To analyze it from the perspective of the minimum necessary to interest an adult audience is pointless. This is a product for uncritical spirits.There is a lot of blood but the action scenes are poorly choreographed, with no sense of pacing or continuity. It's all just a bunch of gags about exploding heads, shattered legs and explosive gunfire but lacking in narrative.The director (sorry, Jonathan) has no sense of story flow and splashes fades to black here and there because the script is full of holes and the stories don't string together.The plot wanders between supposed comedy and bloody space thriller without deciding on either option.The premise of the young girl leaving the shelter to find her father who has been kidnapped is as absurd as the very fact that head-busting Neanderthals have kidnapped her father.A disappointing failure for adults who love speculative fiction, science fiction and dystopias.",4
An absolute delight.,"I am so thrilled this show was as good as it was. It nailed almost everything I hoped it would. It excells not just as a fallout show but as a series of television by itself. Just blast from begining to end.They nailed the feel of the games. The humourous tone is interwoven with mystery, suspense action and character drama. The sets are incredible and the world feels so tactile. There are clever nods to the games, but they never feel like cheap fan-service. The original story is simple but very effective. It allows first time viewers and fans of the games alike to get attached to the characters and setting.In summary, it's just so easy to like Fallout. It has a charm unique to the franchise and it feels like every department was working at their A game. An incredible achievement in video game Adaptations.",10
when you have the abilty to create without pandering,"Even if you have never played any of the games fallout stands as one of the greatest video game adaptions ever put to the small screen
Ambitious, epic, well acted, nuanced and hysterically whimsical. One of the only shows out that not only respects its source material but also respects an audience who just wants to see something amazing.Reminiscent of old spaghetti westerns, The good the bad and the ugly for example it's ambitious in scope while providing a story that isnt complex while making the stakes all the more important. A modern sifi masterpiece that will only get better after watching over and over again.",10

"""Everyone wants to save the world. And they just don't agree on how.""","I think at the beginning I should immediately admit that I am not particularly familiar with the legendary computer game, but in general terms I had an idea about this universe before watching it. I played Fallout Shelter and the Fallout board game, but I couldn't even imagine what this project would be about.Firstly, I can't help but note the gorgeous soundtracks that warm the ears and heart. Excellent musical accompaniment, which many have loved since the games. The music perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere and relieves stress.Secondly, it is impossible not to mention the actors who played in this series. Not super famous, but quite talented Ella Purnell (Lucy) did an excellent job in one of the main roles. Walton Goggins (Ghoul) played a very unusual and interesting role; I was very impressed by the image and storyline of his character. It was extremely unexpected to see Kyle MacLachlan (Hank). And it's very nice that Michael Emerson (Wilzig) also appeared and played a small but significant role for the plot. His appearance was especially nice because I really liked him after the TV series Lost.Thirdly, speaking briefly and about everything at once, it is worth noting the cruelty of some scenes, the presence of black humor, good special effects, excellent pacing of the story and plot.Fourthly, apparently something needs to be said about the plot. The viewer was provided with several storylines of the main characters, which managed to develop well. We also have a mystery shrouded in darkness and one goal, which is pursued by different characters with their own motives. I won't say any details, but I managed to watch 8 episodes in a row in one sitting and got a great impression. I expect to continue for another 2-3 seasons and will look forward to the continuation of the series and, if you like, films. I'm very glad that this project did not fail and I'm sure many will have the same pleasure after watching it as I did.Fifthly, yes, there are some questions about the plot and about some of the characters' actions, but where would we go without that. The series is incredible and there is nothing ingenious or inventive here, but it is a quality product made to last. My respect to the entire film crew..8 out of 10.",8
Well done!,At first I thought it was going to be a goofy show based on a video game and I started watching with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized this show has an intricate story with great character development.The story is interesting and with each episode reveals another layer of this Fallout world and makes you want to keep watching. I think the cast is fantastic! The main girl is my favorite character. She does a great job in selling you her rosy point of view on life. I really like Maximus and the ghoul as well. I look forward to learning more about the ghoul and his origins. I can't wait for season two.,10
Amazing show for anyone to watch!,"First off, the show feels identical to loading up a new fallout game for the first time and playing it, except you're not in control. The story so far is great, with plenty of sub plots to wonder about. I've seen alot of hate from hardcore fans, most of which is speculation because they feel like the writers aren't sticking true to the lore, but they haven't even given them the chance to finish telling the story. They overlook the fact that this show takes place years in the future of the last game in chronological order. Overall a good show that would make any non fan possibly want to play the games. Probably the best video game adaptation made.",9
Pretty darned entertaining.,"Have played all the Fallout games many times over. My initial thought was it seemed to not be like the video games. There was never a case where 3 vaults are set in such close proximity as in the show. But I get this was how they chose to open the story line. So, overlook that because with Vault Tec having over 100 vaults in the US, maybe they did have 3 vaults grouped closely in the LA area.The show does a good job of skipping back in time to show how things originated. As the series progresses the story keeps your interest. Ended up binge watching and now my only disappointment is having to wait for a new season. But will probably rewatch soon because it really is quite good.",10
Fears manifest,"As a longtime fan of Fallout, this was a mere paintjob of Fallout over countless modern-day ideals that would not exist in such a world.If you were expecting something more like Waterworld or Mad Max, solid shows that understood grit in a harsh world from the turn of the century, you will be dissapointed.There are no physical requirements for the Brotherhood of Steel. They allow their initiates to have guts in a world of scarcity. Everything is the modern DEI buzz with a coat of paint over it, the bones and soul of this world is not Fallout, it's our world with a holographic overlay.I don't think writers can even imagine worlds unlike our own anymore, unlike the elite tech companies and creative bubbles of the east and west coast. Over 200 years of radiation, scarcity, military cult purity tests, ignorance, and loss...we are still in the modern day with modern messages only an inch beneath the shallow surface of this 'world'.",2
Hardcore fallout fan here.,"I feel this was a very acceptable adaptation of the fallout universe to TV. Obviously adapting a RPG to film can be difficult, but it was done well. I would say if you're one to nitpick lore details you will find issues with the series, but if you're not detail oriented or care that JET was found in a sealed vault in FO4, you will probably enjoy the show. The worst part is probably some stiff acting from some secondary characters. The leads do well. The action is great as well. I look forward to seeing the second season, I'm supremely confident that some grips will be addressed and improved on. I'm glad to see this adaptation done well. The sets and props look fantastic as well.",8
A Riveting Dive into Post-Apocalyptic Excellence,"Fallout is a testament to the fact that video game adaptations can indeed deliver mature, compelling content on par with acclaimed television series like HBO's The Last of Us (another game adaptation)The series has the ability to appeal to both gaming enthusiasts & newcomers alike. Even if you've never picked up a controller, the richly developed characters & intricately woven plotlines will draw you in effortlessly. The series doesn't rely solely on its gaming roots to carry it forward; instead, it stands confidently on its own merits, offering a fresh & immersive experience for all viewers.The casting choices are spot-on, breathing life into characters that fans of the Fallout franchise have come to love & new viewers can instantly connect with. Ella Purnell's portrayal of Lucy MacLean is nothing short of captivating, bringing depth & resilience to the character as she navigates the harsh realities of the wasteland. Aaron Moten as Maximus, a squire of the Brotherhood of Steel, delivers a performance filled with both strength & vulnerability, showcasing the complexities of survival in a world ravaged by nuclear fallout. Walton Goggins as The Ghoul/Cooper Howard, is a scene-stealer, infusing the series with charisma & mystery that would keep viewers on the edge of their seats.It's a shining example of how a game adaptation can not only do justice to its source material but also transcend it, carving out its own place in the pantheon of great television.In conclusion, if you're looking for a riveting series that seamlessly blends action, drama, thought-provoking themes, look no further than Amazon Prime's Fallout. And as for the next potential game adaptation, I couldn't agree more a series based on BioShock would be an absolute dream come true. Here's hoping that someone out there is listening & ready to bring Rapture to life on the small screen.",9
"Fantastic Adaption, true to the game lore . Fans won't be disappointed.","Okey Dokey, where to begin ?If you're a hardcore fan, this will not let you down.This series has definitely been worth the wait and does not fall into the trap of many game adaptions in which they try to take a 'modern' and 'popular' take on the games, thereby making them almost unrecognizable from the original media.The Fallout series was clearly made by fans and for fans.It has just the right amount of campy, cheesy humour along with over the top gore as well as faction wars and involvement to appease even the most die-hard of fans, with hundreds of easter eggs, it has clearly been influenced by all of the fallout genre and not just FO4 as many fans were afraid.So grab a nuka cola, assume the position, and enjoy.",10
I have watched all 8 Episodes and it is amazing.,"Of course, i would like to listen more of the 50s music overall but, there are 4 main stories, one about Lucy, one about Howard Cooper, one about Maximus and one about her brother. So even every episode is 1 hour long it isn´t gettijng boring, because they can switch between these 4 stories and all 4 are very good written. I would have like, when they would have introduced more side characters, but i am happy with the series like it is. My personal opinion is, that the epised who are made by Nolan are even a little more like the game. I think because Nolan knows the game and he had more recordnicebale music between. The other episodes they are only at the beginning and the ending. A nice exception is the last episode, where the music is fitting. But like I said, i can recommend this series for everyone.",10
Fallout for Fans and New Comers Alike,"I was sceptical coming into this as a long standing fan. It's new and interesting, having their own stand-alone adventure rather than trying to recreate any pre-existing game. Everything looks great, the first episode sucks you in and makes you want to keep watching. All the characters are believable for the world they inhabit. The CGI isnt terrible, believable Brahmin, Yao Guai and power armor. Show clearly took a lot of visual reference from Fallout4/76. A fun experience start to finish.You can enjoy this fun romp into the Fallout universe regardless of if you have played any games, pre-existing knowledge not required.",10
Fallout like we never seen before,"Very rarely I'm impressed like this, and for sure didn't expect to be with this after not so serious trailer, but man oh man I was totally wrong. The detailes implemented from the game were so authentic, and so vast, inumerable. Acting is superb, from all the side roles to the main roles. Directing is top notch, very good plot with great background and little twists, especially Valut Tec background, thank you for that. I literally did a straight 8+ hours marathon, that says it all. They really did justice to Fallout games, and even more. Can't wait for the next season, I hope it stays on same quality level.",10
Absolute Fallout,"The series is a technical masterpiece and rich in details, capturing the essence of the acclaimed Fallout franchise. The original soundtrack and classic old songs immerse you in the immensity of the wastes, until brutal violence or a dash of dark humor bring you back to the post-apocalyptic desolation of the American West. The work has incredible photography, a captivating story, a great plot intertwining the 3 protagonists and great performances - especially that of the necrotic played by Walton Goggins. War never changes, but Fallout has just changed the level of video game film adaptations 👍.",10
Predictable and marketable,"This shows has very predictable, low tier writing and completly retcons the story for an arguably worse version to fit a new vision for the series. I wish for a destruction of bethesda offices and for the director to publicly apologise for the mutulation of this series. The characters are bland and stale and the plot feels lazy and stretched out. This show has no innovation and will not be remembered within next 2 months. This is a massive letdown and has not reached any expectations, it has went below them. I wish in the future shows such as this are not allowed by law and their creators publicly shamed and inprisoned.",2
Certified banger 🔥🔥,"by a self-proclaimed ""OG Fan"" of the series.. Watched it in one day and I can most certainly say IT DESERVES TO BE CANON. It has *some* flaws, but would it be fallout if it didn't...? The acting - 9/10 The story - 9/10 The visuals - 10/10 Lore accuracy - 9/10 ""Fallout feel"" - 9/10I have no idea how any other video game adaptation can top this...
Stays true to the original, while also not forgetting the new ones.SPOILERS:-WARNING FOR NCR FANBOYS - It's gone... reduced to atoms
WARNING FOR BOS FANBOYS - They are not the goody-two-shoes like Fallout 4
WARNING FOR VAULT-TEC FANBOYS - A very very big surprise is waiting for you.",10
BRAVO. Film making excellence.,"Wow, what a ride into a dystopian nightmare that is all too beautiful to take your eyes off, for even a moment. This is what films were meant to be. This one happens to be broken out into 8 episodes. Even better. Cannot say enough about the casting. Actors were fantastic. Walton Goggins just had his greatest performance. A Cillian Murphy/Peaky Blinders type role. Should receive awards for this. The soundtrack. The soundtrack. Haunting. Dreamlike. Perfect. I have watched many shows in 40 years. I have witnessed all of Amazons best. I dare say this is Amazons finest production of all time. Watch it. Now.",10
Pay no attention to...,"... the mediocre and bad reviews. I doubt they even watched the entire show. The reviews are full of cliché wanna be critic buzzwords. I would bet they used ChatGPT.The show is full of wonderful set design, hilariously fun violent action and interesting characters. Great acting, great dialogue, great directing, Plus, a story that is full of surprises, engaging and becomes more and more intriguing as the story moves forward.I never played the game, but I knew what it looked like. They nailed the look, feel, and humor. It's full of great cameos, and no one is safe.I finished it in three days. Highly recommend.",10
Best show that is based on a great video game I ever watched,The fallout series is ten times better than the halo series like I love both of the games but the fallout series became more accurate and the storyline was amazing. It did gave me a mad max saga vibe but this show definitely needs a season 2 to continue the story. I knew I be hooked to this show when I saw the teaser. Happy that they finally made a show about this game.It does make me wanting to play all of the fallout games again honestly.10/10 recommended to give this show a shot. Y'all wouldn't be disappointed especially if y'all like the Fallout game as well.Hope season 2 comes soon!,10
Great so far,"This is great so far. I love how it incorporates the game I played (iPad). Very creative and catches my interest. I only have one issue so far and that's Lucy leaving the vault. This chick has been underground her entire life. She leaves and has absolutely no noticeable astonishment or reaction to sand, trees, sky, wind, ocean, etc, maybe I'm being picky but after 20+ years underground? Weird. Maybe if they had scripted some excitement or reaction, her journey outside would be a little more monumental. I'm also trying to figure out why all these people living above ground don't seem to have mutations. Otherwise really enjoying the show and will certainly keep watching it. Sometimes you just have to go with the flow.",9
Top-Notch Adaptation,"I was a huge fan of the Fallout 1 and 2 video games. I also loved the later games, although the gloominess made the them difficult for me to play for extended periods. While I don't remember a lot of the details of the games, this series felt like a spot-on adaptation of the spirit and aesthetics of the games.The production quality is first rate. The acting, writing, sets, and visual effects are superb. One thing I loved in particular is how they solved the problem I had with the later Fallout games: breaking up the gloom. They did this by alternating between gloomy scenes and vibrant ones. Not only did this make the gloom manageable, it helped to emphasize the contrast among the different worlds. Very well done.",10
Worth watching,"MASTERPIECE don't miss it I give solid 10/10 background song music awesome.the background music top notch and best game adaption.the dilogue okiea docky really loved the dilogue.screen play,world exploration, people mind set ,wasteland experience everything is awesome perfect web series.iam really loved the heroine character she such a beautiful women her expression loveable.character developement good .first time I see no negatives have this searise.ghoul character design really good more important given the searise comparatively protagonist.i am started watching second time the searise.reagionl language dubbing also awesome the local bad words really enjoyable 😂.",10
Wanted to like it but I didn't,"Fallout is based on a video game that I have not played, and know nothing about, so I am probably not the target audience for this show. However, I do like scifi, and the premises sounded interesting, and it is, taking place in a post-apocalyptic world.The show is decently done, and visually it looks good, the budget must be substantial. The acting is decent, and the show is a mixture of three themes, the 50s, cowboys and future-esque. It is interesting to see these mixed together, but at the same time they don't really properly mix, but just co-exist mostly separately.The storytelling is very much from the school of video games, in the way that the characters are sort of introduced separately, then a lot of information is listed, and then they go on a quest. It didn't particularly appeal to me nor capture my attention, as a person who does not play a lot of video games. (Though The Last of Us was able to do this very successfully for non-gamers in my opinion.)The characters are flat. The main character, Lucy, is kind of annoying and unrelatable, with her completely unrealistic naivite and blind optimism. She doesn't really feel like a whole character, but just some form of male fantasy. Maximus is even worse, he's so flat and without any character trades that he doesn't even manage to be annoying. The Ghoul has charisma, and is interesting, but doesn't get enough screentime to hold up the show on his own.There are no interpersonal relationships formed really, in the first episodes of the show. It's just three separate characters, occasionally meeting but mostly just interacting and fighting with various NPCs, which is very boring to me, as a non-gamer. So it is very difficult to keep the attention.Finally, for me, the absolute worst part is the soundtrack. It feels very forced, deliberate and pretencious. 50s songs are forced onto scenes where most of the time they make no sense, preventing me from falling into the story. Then the songs suddenly stop and the feel of the scene instantly changes (because it never fitted with the 50s music to begin with), making the storytelling very discontinuous, especially in relation to the feel of the story, and emotions conveyed in each scenes. The future-esque music that is used for fighting scenes and exciting storypoints is very slow and depressing, and does the opposite of making me engaged in this story. So overall the soundtrack is just very annoying and/or boring to me, overbearing to the point that it rips my attention away from the story. (An exception of this is Johnny Cash, obviously, as Johnny Cash is almost always a good choice). From what I hear, though, this is a fundamental part of the Fallout-verse, and the music has so much of a presence, and its own character (peraps too) independent from the tv show that I am sure some people will love it.I admit this is written after only watching three episodes, so maybe it does get better. I just can't watch more of this show to find out.Overall, this is not a bad show. It was just not for me (which is Ok) and is probably more catered to fans of Fallout, and video games in general.",4
Stunning!!,"Never played the game, so knew nothing about this show!!! Watched it in 2 days!! Gripped from the first episode to the last!! If I hadn't have had to sleep I would have done it in 1 sitting.The story is outstanding the actors are pitch perfect and the production is better than anything I have seen in a very long time.I usually avoid shows with graphic violence and horror but this was not gratuitous but rather something that pushed the story forward!This is my first review of any show and it was so good that I am actually taking the time to write this!!More,more and more PLEASE!!!I hope season 2 will keep up the amazing work!!",10
Great Adaptation,"Best J. Nolan work since Westworld S1, and those are some big words. HAVEN'T played the games myself but the world building here is top notch, everything feels real in it's own way and all the pieces start piecing together with the right tempo.If I had to say one thing, the first few episodes are quite slow, they have something but the fall short compared to the rest, but hey, better to have some slow first episodes than bad last ones.On the acting side of things, the ghoul is one of the best I've seen this year, both in the flashbacks and ghouls scenes. There's no character that feels out. A must watch for sure.",9
Perfect Fallout vibe,"I usually don't leave reviews, but this show really deserves it. This is the only adaptation of a video game that actually did it right, and preserved the games feel. I appreciate that they didn't just took the storyline from one of the games, but made their own main plot within the universe of Fallout. If you played the games, you will feel that the show fits right in, and could easily be an expansion. And unlike some other book/game adaptations, if you didn't play the games, it is still quite clear to understand what is going on.The acting was great, I feel like most of the charachters would fit perfectly within the game world. There is quite a lot of game anecdotes within the show, just enough to bring the feeling of nostalgia. So all in all 10/10.",10
Phenomenal Show!!,"It's as if all the best parts of ""the last of us"", ""the Witcher"" and ""westworld"" got together and made a SUPER BABY that I could not stop watching. I couldn't find a single thing negative to say about this show if I tried. Walton Goggins absolutely killed it in this and all the main cast just blew me away. Awesome writing, awesome acting, awesome cinematography and awesome directing tend to make for an awesome show and FALLOUT certainly did not disappoint. So if you haven't seen it, please do yourself a huge favor and give it a watch. You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you miss this one. Phenomenal Show!!!",10
"Gorgeous music, great visuals ,subpar writting","Like most of the series nowadays, the script is bland and full of cliches, like the fact that there is an army that somehow moves huge airships with little explanation on how they get the fuel or ressources, the characters always find their way into each other by coincidence with little to no explanation to how they did, lots of plot holes and things that don't make sense, the story is too silly at times and undercooked. I don't mind the violence but at times it feels too gratuitous. I will say that the visuals and the music and cinematic artistry is triple A quality. I still had a great time watching it, but the story is underwhelming at best. Regardless, the show all around is high quality and tight technically.",8
We want more shows like these please!,"For these days & age its a perfect show.8 full episodes with no fillers, great choice of music with 50's oldies giving the atmosphere with every scene is interesting, contributing to the general plot & feel of the show.The main characters are all good, Goggins.as always is spectacular.(watch for those ""Justified"" cameos from a few Boyd's ""friends"")
I hadn't played the game, but I can sure feel the vibe the game gives to the show as a post apocalyptic age.Same as a lot of those shows, there's a few flashback scenes, but in the show there all great & mysterious.Well done Amazon for this, I think it may better than ""The Last of Us""",10
Not just the best game adaptation. It is the best amazon prime series of al time,"Before I watched it , I thought it will be a shallow and just a casual low budget series that is made to promote the games. As someone who played all of it's games, even though they are good, I believe it's very hard to turn that universe to cinema. They did not just nail it but this is seriously the best prime video exclusive series of all time. After their ridiculous lord of the rings and wheel of time(s1) adaptations, I'm glad that this turned out to be very well.All episodes are full with misteries and it never let viewer get bored. Characters are hard to relate at first but it you connect them very fast as you keep watching.",10
There Is Literally Nothing New Under This Orange-Colored Sky (But It Looks Real Purty),"This series plays like the classic post-apocalyptic story A Boy and His Dog, only in reverse. At some point, the trope of subterranean bourgeois overlords in an irradiated wasteland populated by mutants became twisted by the legacy of that successful story into what we see today. The journey from there to here would be an interesting subject to discuss at greater length. Suffice it to say that this series is several steps back in a few different directions at the same time without being in any way offensive to aficionados of the genre.A few creative choices that may have been technical difficulties mar this production. Repeatedly there are shots taken with what must be a wide-angle lens that fail to find any focus on their subject; the entire screen remains in a blurry, unfocused haze despite a well-framed and obvious subject. This may have something to do with the cameras used to film series like this, since the same thing happens in Shogun--although in Shogun, it happens often enough to acquire some arguable significance. Here it just seems incredibly lazy. I assume that lobbyists from the wide-angle lens industry would only let management let up in last year's strikes on the condition that more of their products be forced upon people who don't know or care about their effective use.Aside from these brief moments of WTF, this show looks almost perfect. With a darker filter and more emphasis on violence this could be a 10/10. Unfortunately it takes the road more often traveled of pulling punches in a world defined by brutality. I guess I just want Rob Zombie's Fallout presented by Eli Roth. This is fine until then.Edit: I added 3 stars when I saw just how many people are dog-whistling to their fellow fascists in the reviews here. Congratulations, guys, you found another dumb thing to be offended over. What next, you'll say that the X-Men aren't a metaphor?",10
A top-notch game adaptation,"Gone are the days of Uwe Boll.The recent adaptation of The Last of Us is the gold standard against which all game adaptations will be measured and while there are many out there, it's generally the anime-style the gather appreciation since the animated genre is more malleable to provide the kind of elements generally required while live-action lives and dies on the strength of the story, characters and acting.Fallout shines in the direction department. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy join forced with Bethesda game designer Todd Howard. Nolan's name alone would gather respect but next to a Bethesda game designer, the hopes from this adaptation are high and it doesn't disappoint.The story draws on all the right elements of the franchise and builds deeply within the post-apocalyptic Fallout world. The story is really well thought out and brings enough background that the detailed-oriented viewers who haven't enjoyed the games also have a good shot at immersing themselves in the story.The only thing that feels shaky is the acting. It's not consistent all around and while overall the cast does a good job, it's not just that (obviously) some actors do a better job than others, it's also that nobody is consistent in their craft.It's a fairly minor issue, but I can see the potential for it to get tiresome. Overall though, it's an amazing series that makes the subscription to Prime Video worth it all by itself.",10
Ruined by the soundtrack,"Not a Fallout player, I don't care for the game. This is a TV series ruined by the soundtrack. This series isn't a disaster, don't get me wrong, I recognize the value and greatness of oldies music, but people who like this kind of music don't share a taste for splatter gore. There are things that just don't add up and this is one of them. The show is aimed at the present generation, who as much as they appreciate the oldies, they have their different tastes above them. At least I find the music to be boring, strident, and out of place. Apart from having to lower the volume every time the music is presented, resulting in noise, something that is not fair. It's a misuse of something as valuable as the music of bygone good all times.I like the Western-style narrative, the story is fine, and many elements of dark humor and horrific scenes. Some episodes that lack substance can be annoying at times, and there comes the happy everything is gone be all right music again, and again, and again. I have been following Jonathan Nolan since his brother Sir Christopher Nolan adapted Jonathan's short story ""Memento Mori"" into the film Memento (2000). Also favorites like Person of Interest, The Dark Knight, Interstellar and Westworld. From the latter seems to come the character of Walton Goggins as The Ghoul. If it hadn't been for the inconvenience of the soundtrack, I would have given it a 10 for the excellent cinematography, but there is an 9 for every time I have to mute it in each episode.",9
"Fallout, Fallout, Fallout!!😎","As a gamer, I was very excited to see how this adaptation would be to watch. However, i wasn't too skeptical and afraid the show would be bad when I saw that Jonathan and Lisa were involved. I have 753 hours in Fallout: New Vegas (best Fallout game in my opinion) and 126 hours in Fallout 4. So to see that they have done so fantastic job of taking the things from the games and making them an exact copy, was just awesome! I will probably get back into a new game of New Vegas soon😂 The story is of course not from the games, but I think that is a good idea, to get a completely new story in this universe is great. I like that they have backstories for the characters and that we got some answers on who started it all. The ending of episode 8, well, I got goosebumps and a BIG smile on my face👍 Can't wait for season 2 and hopefully even more seasons😁",10

Best video game adaptation since Arcane,"I've played all the Fallout games including its predecessor Wasteland and this show almost brings a tear to this old gamers eyes. A faithful adaption in everyway, bundled with an interesting story filled with intrigue. All the characters are flawed on various levels but you'd expect that in a post-apocalyptic world. No one is really likeable but they are at least relatable as they each show us what could be the ugliest parts of ourselves.The set pieces are top notch and oftentimes look just like the games. They spared no expense here. Actors were cast well and it was good to see some old names like Ponch from CHIPs make an appearance.We don't get shows this good often which is a shame and when we do we feel spoiled. Hopefully this isn't a one hit wonder and the next season if there is one will be just as good.",10
Better than your average adaptation,"Name a game or book adaptation that followed 100%...you can't! So don't hate on this for being a little off. Creative direction can make a story better than the game, it can also be the opposite.When it comes to this...1) The visuals are amazing and on par with the games!!!2) The acting is good to awesome, nothing too horrible on delivery.3) The game match story match up...well it is lacking details for the game enthusiasts.4) It is worth your time, even if you are not a fan of the games or game storylines in general.5) Plenty of action, twists, dystopia themes and drama, romance, and a pinch of humor.I have played the games. I appreciate the production team for making this the best video game adaptation I have seen to date! Thank you for delivering quality entertainment that can be enjoyed by non-gamers and gamers alike.Keep up the good work and looking forward to season 2!",8
Fallout is trying too hard to be dystopian,"Having never played the game I am scoring, and reviewing, this solely on the merits of the TV show, and compared to other shows (for example Halo, Into the Badlands, Shadows and Bones), it tries too hard to look and feel dystopian to maintain suspension of disbelief.Every opportunity is used to play some old 50's/60's music could not more feel like someone got a free jukebox and insists that it be used in every scene, even when the music has zero bearing on the scenes and does nothing to evoke the feelings the director undoubtedly intended to invoke.I might give it a chance to see how it develops but based on just the first two episodes it's a hard storyline to follow and any and all cohesion between the different storylines to allow non-Fallout-gamers to get seemed to have gotten lost in translation, with too much time spent on trying to force feed you the rather poorly presented misery of the world, instead of using that time to let the dystopian-ness reveal itself through solid story-telling.",4
Phenomenal!,"This is an amazing TV show, whether you played the games or not. Immaculate casting led to incredible performances, backed up by an excellent script and spot-on pacing. Cherry on top is the production level, which is through the roof.Just like The Last of Us, this also captures the essence of the original material, while also making it work flawlessly in a different medium. But, again just like in TLOU, you don't need to have played the games to appreciate the immense effort and quality behind this TV show, because it stands on its own as a genuine work of art that will value every moment of your time you choose to dedicate to it. Highly recommended!",10
Terrific adaptation,"As a dinosaur Fallout gamer who spent almost 3 decades playing nearly every game in this universe I am very much pleased with this adaptation. The producers showed utmost respect to us gamers including even the tiniest details from the game universe which is quite a challenging task considering a vast gaming universe and endless lore.Acting, scenario, CGI, soundtrack and everything else I can think of are top notch in this show. This show expands the Fallout canon beyond Fallout 4 which makes it an essential part of the canon and a must see for all Fallout gamers. As for the rest who are not familiar with the game it's a great way to enter the Fallout universe and considering how well the scenario is written I'm sure they won't be disappointed as well.After an intense binge watching I'm already waiting eagerly for the second season. Kudos to the entire Fallout team.",10
"True to the games, closer to the ones in the West Coast (1, 2, NV). Holds its own as a TV Show.","I've played all the Fallout games and have thousands of hours between NV and 3. When the show was first announced, I rolled my eyes. I didn't think it would do the games justice or respect it. But then I saw who was writing it, and who was acting in it (Walton Goggins), so fast forward a couple days ago.The show has great writing, acting and directing. The characters are engaging and likeable (Maximus, Lucy, The Ghoul). The setting (and it's visuals) are extremely faithful and accurate to the games. At a certain point I almost took a screenshot because I thought I was playing a Fallout game.The show is closer to 1, 2 and New Vegas because of where it is set. I badly felt like replaying New Vegas while watching the show. I'm one of the biggest fanboys of that game you'll find. Where it mixes in the modern games is the look of the Vaults, the terminal UI, and the general look of building/house interiors.This show has better writing than any of the recent modern Fallout games. It simply does as far main stories and side quests go - things I ignore in favor of exploring and discovering the stories in the environment.What the show does better than the games is the depiction of Ghouls. Things I'd just make swiss cheese instead of giving a second thought. But in the show, they show how dark and sad it is when ghouls are about to go feral. They were truly scary.BoS is actually menacing and dark compared to the games. Knights wearing power armor have an ominous and awesome presence. In the beginning, it reminded me of the Sith in Star Wars. Take the armor off, and maybe things aren't what they seem. In the games, they are very, very boring and mediocre save for some personalities here and there.The Vault story was told just as excellently as the games' many Vaults.The intro of the show is better than the intro of any game besides New Vegas' intro (which is badass), for which it probably goes side to side with it.Walton Goggins' character is incredible, even in the pre-war. He's one of the best actors of all time, I know this from having watched Justified 5 times or more.My only criticism or thing I would change in the show is how a certain city came to its ruin. It could have come to ruin in a more ""better written"", more respectable way? But I suppose a lot of things happen in the games that aren't exactly described as respectful.You don't need to play the games to enjoy the show, but you will get far more enjoyment if you have played all of them, especially 1, 2, and NV. You get the references, know all the enemies (Yao Guai, Gulper, Feral Ghouls, etc.), recognize the propganda. I like looking at items in the games, so I felt rewarded when I recognized the Salty Prospector Saloon's beans in the show.It's the attention to detail that make Fallout great.I like that the show is canon because it's the closest thing we'll get to a New Vegas sequel, but hopefully the next game can also go back to the West Coast and we can explore what the show left us.",9
Fallout - A Captivating Journey Through an Alternate Post-Apocalyptic America,"The highly anticipated ""Fallout"" TV series, based on the popular video game franchise, has finally arrived. While the show's eight-episode run left fans craving more, it managed to deliver a compelling narrative, impressive production values, and outstanding performances.One of the series' greatest strengths lies in its engaging storyline, which follows a female vault dweller on a mission to rescue her kidnapped father. The show's writers have done an excellent job of adapting the game's lore and creating a fresh, yet familiar, narrative that keeps viewers hooked. The alternative history of the United States, combined with clever political satire, adds depth to the world-building and provides a thought-provoking backdrop for the characters' adventures.However, the show is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the inclusion of a mixed-race couple and a lesbian relationship to be forced and unnecessary. Felt like they were added to check boxes rather than serving the story organically. Additionally, the presence of a character who bears a striking resemblance to John Boyega from the Star Wars franchise may come across as contrived to some.A Female Vault Dweller's Rescue Mission to Save Her Kidnapped FatherRK
Let's do a review of a TV show. Give me an engaging title at the top. First off this series is 8 episodes and I really wanted it to go for another two or so. The cons were the clearly forced mixed race couple, unnecessary lesbian relationship, and a knock off of John Boyega from Star wars which seemed contrived once again. The pros were that I Loved the storyline, alternative USA History, political satire, albeit I missed the horses from the video game - I'm told mutant horses would consume enormous special effects costs so they're skipped in this series. The protagonist is a female vault dweller who's dad gets kidnapped and she goes off to rescue him. Production was top quality sets, etc. Actors also were great. Walton Goggins shines as the ghoul and was a perfect match for the role.TV Series Review: Fallout - A Captivating Journey Through an Alternate Post-Apocalyptic AmericaThe highly anticipated ""Fallout"" TV series, based on the popular video game franchise, has finally arrived.

While representation is important, these elements can sometimes feel like they were added to check boxes rather than serving the story organically. Additionally, the presence of a character who bears a striking resemblance to John Boyega from the Star Wars franchise may come across as contrived to some.Despite these minor drawbacks, ""Fallout"" excels in its production quality. The sets, costumes, and visual effects are top-notch, immersing the audience in the post-apocalyptic world. While fans of the video game may miss the presence of mutant horses, the decision to omit them due to high special effects costs is understandable.The acting in the series is another highlight, with the cast delivering strong performances across the board. Walton Goggins, in particular, shines as the ghoul character, bringing the perfect blend of humor, grit, and humanity to the role. His portrayal is a testament to the show's casting directors, who have assembled a talented ensemble to bring the ""Fallout"" universe to life.In conclusion, ""Fallout"" is a must-watch for fans of the video game series and newcomers alike. While it may have its shortcomings, the show's engaging storyline, impressive production values, and outstanding performances more than make up for them. As viewers eagerly await news of a potential second season, they can revel in the fact that the ""Fallout"" TV series has successfully captured the essence of the beloved franchise.",9
War never changes,"From the get go this is the Fallout I loved playing as a kid .It's fun and stays true to the random and obscure events that happen in the game . I think the writers have done a great job of creating a story worthy of the fallout series, I for one cannot wait for the next season.The acting is great and I think the casting is spot on . Especially cooper (Walton) who really nails the role to a T. And I am exited to see what S2 has in store, hopefully more of the same!I am not well versed on the aspects of film making but I thought the cinematography was very well done especially in the final episodes.I may be bias but my favourite parts were seeing the brotherhood in action and the flashback revelations!",9
Another excellent game adaptation,"I haven't played the games so I might be highly critical on its accuracy, however, as a general viewer this was a refreshing, unique and excellent tv show for a change.The shows keeps you engaged by simply not revealing too much too quick. The story is well paced across its run time with a good character arc that builds up evenly between its characters.In addition, also loved the fact that each characters discovery helps reveal the hidden gems of the plot, with a catchy conclusion to the finale of season 1, I personally can't wait for season 2.I am more than happy to recommend this tv show to anyone and if you reading this review, it's worth giving this show a try.",9
Not disappointed,"Absolutely loved it! Great adaptation with enough throwbacks to the games to keep me interested! Can't wait for season 2. The action was great, the ghoul was an awesome character that you would find loving and hating at the same time. Lucy was an interesting character and Maximus added good humor. The rich vault tech history made it interesting and the plot twists are there to keep you wanting to watch. Throughly enjoyed this adaptation. Some minor issues are easily overlooked with well written story and phenomenal acting of the main characters. Wish tv shows still ran 22 episodes a season! Only downside is waiting for season 2.",10
I love quirky. This missed the mark,"I used to watch my son play the game and it seemed quite entertaining. I love quirky movies and television shows that most people do not enjoy. I fell asleep three times in two nights watching this program. I kept trying on night three, but it hasn't kept my interest. I'm supposed to write six hundred characters, but I don't find the need to denigrate any this tv show. The Fallout TV show was just not my cup of tea. Enjoy it if you wish. I just found it flat and boring. I guess I've never made a review before, because I find this character limit absolutely pointless too. I guess this is my last review.",3
Amaong,"As a lover of the games, I was hesitant about this series. BUT! It doesn't disappoint. Absoloutely worth the watch for lovers of the game and those who never played it alike. It covers all details both pre and post 'the bombs falling' which allows the viewers to understand the history of the games but enjoy the series without having played a single minute of the game. Weather a fusion core or bottle caps are your choice, a trade is worth it to watch this series and eagerly await the 2nd series when we this will be! Enjoy the eliquor, grab a stimpak (avoid the jet) and settle in for the lessons of a lifetime after the bombs fall.",10
As a Fallout1/2 fan I'm delighted,"This is seriously good! The world is true to the original, a non black'n'white Fallout mess we all love. It's funny, it's grim but it also adds more to the original games story. Which is good! This is actually in my opinion why some fans don't like it. Because it adds to the original stories. And that's why it's good in my humble opinion.In addition the visuals are great. Quite true to Bethesda games rather than original 1 and 2.Actors are doing a great work and the character development keeps you involved with actual characters.If I would be asked what's bad about it, maybe it could be more dark humor in it, like killing kids as in the original. But hey it's 2024 and we are living in a softer world. The authors still got a pregnant woman shooting machine gun, it's something.Go watch it, you'll love it. Meanwhile I'm going to play Fallout 2 for 109th time!",9
Soo fun,"I really enjoyed season 1 i found it to be such a fun watch everything just felt entertaining, and i was left wanting more after each episode, you bet i'll be faithfully waiting for the next season and just excited for future easter eggs and New places. The songs at the end of each episode was a great touch while you look at the art of the show and games. Everyone casted has been great they just all seem to fit in perfectly, great set design and a great adaptation of the games, the costumes look great, the makeup, and effects perfect. I can't wait to see what other great stuff comes from this series.",10
Nuka-Cola Tastes Good,"I've been trying to write this for days, but now that I'm supposed to be preparing for my exam tomorrow, I felt it was about the right time.When I first saw the trailer back in December, knowing that one of the Nolan's was making the series, I was almost certain it would be awesome, at least i was hoping, and luckily my expectations were met.The Last of Us lost the battle. For me, Last of Us hasn't been in the number 1 spot on the ""best game adaptation"" podium as much as it has been for most of the audience, but Fallout has definitely knocked it off the top spot. Everyone was amazed at how good the Last of Us was as a video game adaptation, but i wasn't impressed, i found it pretty average, i didn't feel it was much more better than The Walking Dead 1-2 seasons, even if it wasn't about zombies.The stories and subplots of the Fallout are well suited to presenting a post apocalyptic world. Normally I don't tend to be particularly interested in anything ""visual stunning"", because it can age badly over the years, but it has to be said, this world created is really visually stuning, ""beautiful"" and well constructed. The 50's sets and soundtrack are stunning, reminding me of the series Lost, where the songs ""Downtown"" or ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"" are played when they hit the cliffhanger. The characters are alive, the black humour is sufficient and fine.About naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), sometimes it's hard to decide whether she's funny or annoying, but I'll stick with funny. She's a well-developed character, really like someone who has grown up in a shell and is now confronted with the horrors of the world, that the world is a ""dark and full of terrors"".The actor who played Maximus (Aaron Moten) unfortunately didn't show his acting talent during the 8 episodes, somehow I didn't like his character so much, he is less developed, not as well as the other characters.Obviously in the series it's Walton Goggins, playing the Cooper Howard/Ghoult character, who totally steals the show. It's hard to decide if he's a hero, antihero or a villain. The flashbacks are very fasinating, and the way we learn more and more of his backstory from his past is well dosed, reaching the catharsis and necessary cliffhanger in the last episode, which makes us look forward to the next season of the series. An another Nolan quote that has already come to mind is ""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain.""As a big Twin Peaks and Dune (Lynch) fan, I was very pleased with Kyle MacLachlan's performance, especially the Dale Cooper thumbs up. From Arrakis to the Wasteland.Let's hope that the next seasons of the series do not go the way of The Witcher series.",9
As a guy who played Fallout,"The trailers gave me hope. But actually watching the series. It was felt like another quest well done. It really felt like I was in the wastelands trying to make make sense of of what is happening. The series had some of its own ideas in making the story work, but it actually made sense and worked. I really liked the main characters . Especially the the way they acted and the choices that they made. The first time you play a fallout game , you try to be as good as you can. But players will know that doesn't last long. And that's what makes it interesting. It makes you think. It makes you choose. I hope that people will give this show a shot. Because it was all I could hope it would be.",10
It Does Not Mess With The Lore!,This show sets the bar for what gamers want to see in a show about their favorite game.Fallout has been stunning to look at. The story is constantly intriguing. The characters are complex and developed. They've kept the lore of the previous games without taking liberties with them.There are some important and iconic Fallout beasts and weapons that do not make an appearance. But I feel confident those will appear in later seasons.Fallout is something I am going to watch a dozen times between season 1 and Season 2 (which I suspect will come out in 2032 if they follow true Bethesda lore and only release a new game/season every 8 years).,10
Everything Clever About This is Dumb,"Based on a video game? Never would have guessed. This seems exactly like the kind of clever noise a few dozen up-and-coming TV producers at Amazon might come up with when their job is on the line. ""Bring me something violent and fun that will cost a lot of money and grab the attention of the unwashed masses. Preferably the unwashed gamer masses. Something like 'Last of Us', but with zingers. One-liners and more explosions. Maybe some CGI bugs? A cute girl or two? And how about a semi-famous co-star who always plays the semi-famous co-star? Make sure there's at least one lowly underdog we can hire a minority actor for, but make them comedy relief with a heart. Robots and zombies if possible.""If it were any fun at all, Fallout would be a low-stakes delight. Beautiful production design and game actors, a pedigree and a budget. But it's all so instantly dumb. Badly written, choppy, and nonsensical, Fallout's attention span is shorter than the ads that precede it. Action comedy is hard to land. Both have to be tight - the filmmakers have to establish tone. Fallout insists on being taken seriously all the while slapping the audience with vaudeville-level pratfalls and gags. It's more fun watching real-life 'fail' vids than a team of artists trying to recreate them.",3
Appreciated so far as a Fan but if i wasn't a fan would it be still a good tv series ?,"As a dedicated Fallout Fan as myself i would like to tell a story about how i encountered with this wonderfull Fallout world in first place . When i was a kid back then my brother and i 've one shared computer soo we played in turns , soo in those not my turn times i was soo excited to wait my turn to play , soo while i waiting , i sometimes visit my uncle's house which his house was near to my family house , my cousin who is couple of years older than me plays with his computer . I watched him or sometimes he let me to play it some of his games . I first experienced games like Monkey island 3 , Might And Magic 6 , Need For Speed 2 and also he had previous gaming console which he had have Amiga Gaming Console back then so i played Street Fighter 2 , Lotus racing game and soo many other kinds of arcade games with his machines .Then one day , i saw him to play one particular game the year was 1999 i think , the game itself has soo many features and soo enriched in materials that game amazed me back then and still it is , this game name was Fallout 2 . It has well written dialogs and options that you've deciding into and leads to you the way that how you would like to go on it was up to your decisions . First time i saw it's character creation sheet , i simply amazed in it's wonderful features in it .There is a pointing system that , there is some limitations so you decide that what kind of character you would like to dive into this world , game itself giving you this option is up to your desire . You can choose to be play as dumbest person and still finish the game and play as intelligent person and still finish the game it's up to you that what kind of gaming style you would like to play . And also it's features mostly based on text dialogs back then helped my to develop my english skills . I 've had a story that when i was in middle school , our english teacher asked us , how to say buy in english . I responded her to say , it's Barter :D :) well technically it goes into same direction but not as expected as the teacher thought . But still she was amazed that how this child knows to word barter but not knows the word Buy . That's the one of the story i've on Fallout can continue with soo many others . This game broadened my horizon , gave me soo many other point of views to look into my upcoming events in my life . The game itself has a incredible deep story about what could be happen if there
would be global nuclear war happens all around the world and what would be the outcome if such thing happens , of course it has soo many fictional things happens but it's main idea is simple , the biggest weapon on humanity have is nuclear weapons right now and this weapon could lead back to humanity . It's stil is one of the biggest threat for our earth and this game tells a story about that .I wouldn't like to give more detailed information about Fallout universe but the thing is i expected from this TV Series is give the general idea of this universe and gives some of the fundamentals of
this universe . It's still giving some information but there are some minor details like if the TV Series could explained it , it would attract more people rather than only get attention of Fallout fans.Some of them like the people ain't have any idea about Fallout universe might not know that why the people lives like 1950's style in 2070's ? Why the computerized systems soo bulky ? What was the enemy of The United States , who the hell was this Reds ( Communists ) is this tv series is refering into . Those kind of minor things could give more relief to the viewers , that those are first time experiencing this universe but on other hand as a Fallout fan as myself it's a almost 10/10 TV Series soo far but realistically cause of these minor things it goes down a little bit into 9/10 . And there is also one other thing which is i believe to mentioned it , the story itself in TV Series built in 1 Epic Story which i think that , with that story , the story is now focused on hope rather than it suppose to explain it the total desperation of humanity . Now with that story we've known of , we know that if this thing the tv series is mentioned somehow might be happen in a right way , most of the problems of the humanity would resolve . I hope that the writers of this tv series find a way about to continue on this tv series as much hyped as possible . This Fallout universe is the best fictional universe in my life , i hope that this tv series represent it well . In my personal thoughts i liked it soo far . Thanks again for everyone for their contributions on this wonderfull project .I would like to first thank Tim Cain , Brian Fargo , Leonard Boyarsky , Chris Taylor , Feargus Urquhart , Chris Avellone , Mark Morgan , Todd Howard and soo many other wonderfull developers , artists and other members to make this universe special .I would like to thank each member of this TV Series , that those people represent this universe as accurate as possible .",9
Amazing! Watched it all in one day,"This show is amazing if you are open to it and let it keep entertaining you. I do like the world of fallout and its setting and honestly they couldn't have done it any better, every show considering its setting has its maximum potential and its amazing to see what they've done here. Give it a chance, likeable and diverse characters, great acting, jawdropping set-pieces and an attention to detail you won't see so often. You can tell this has been done by experienced and forward thinking directors. I am very much in hope for season 2 and I think for sure this will get another season or two. We'll done 9.5/10.",10
Captured the game; the humor dumbs it down,"This show is interesting, outstanding acting, the visuals are awesome, reminds me a little of Silo, and the pacing is nice.For me, the only thing I don't like that I think devalues everything is the humor. The humor is ""stupid"" and absurd; it makes everything less dramatic, less serious, less intense. I was hoping for this show to be more scary, dark, and intense like The Last of Us. The stupidity the humor brings just really puts me off, it feels like it ruins the execution of the scenes and plot. It's like they are making fun of themselves! It's a little exhausting to watch. Other than that, I think it's another excellent video game adaptation!Side note: Yes, I have played the games. Favorites of mine. And no, I don't think the humor in the show is the same humor in the games. The games felt more serious to me but that's just my experience.All in all, you don't want to miss this one!",8
"Funny, Brutal and Perfect","Let me start by saying 'lore is wrong blah blah blah'. Who cares. This series is so lovingly crafted by individuals who quite obviously cherish the Fallout universe. If you are seeing negative reviews over 'false lore', do yourself a favor and ignore every word!I've grown up on these games and was super apprehensive about the series being a flop... This is a better adaption than I could have ever hoped for! It's a perfect balance of drama, silliness and mindless brutal violence. The 3 main characters are all brilliant, but Lucy is a different level. The vault dwelling newbie to the wasteland adds such fun element to the series... It's as if I was watching a friend play the games for the first time!Perfection. Go watch now.",10
Great....but what's with the horrendous music?,"Can't say enough great things about this show and other reviewers have stated the obvious. But no one mentions the blasting, god awful music that is playing whenever the scenes switch to the Vault or Lucy's character. Often the music overrides the dialogue and lasts the duration of the song. Seriously? There is absolutely no connection of the music with the scenes. I get that the director want's to imply a long past era of when the vault was set up, but that would be the early atomic age of the late 50's and early 60's. Sorry, the music doesn't fit as most of the soundtrack dates from 1940's to early 1950's and is screeching too loud. This works for Boardwalk Empire, but not this show. One can only guess that the producers went on the cheap and acquired free music that is part of the public domain rather than pony up and purchase some of the outstanding music of the correct time period.",9
An outstanding video games adaptation!,"From Video Games to Live-Action TV Series, in Video Games Fallout allowing me to explore post-apocalyptic landscapes and engage in captivating narratives. These gaming sessions on the back day became cherished memories of my childhood, as I navigated through the unique worlds presented in each installment of the Fallout franchise. The franchise underwent a notable transformation, transitioning from its roots as a Turn-Based tactical RPG to a first-person shooter Open World RPG . The games feature a protagonist navigating a post-apocalyptic world, facing challenges to survive.Fallout universe encapsulates everything I adore - classic radio podcast '50s music on a Pipboy, encounters with random NPCs providing quests, desert-patrolling robots, radiation-resistant power armor, lurking feral ghouls, super mutants, raiders, various bizarre Mutant Creatures, Upgradable Weapon and Leveling up some skills Perks they're also Multiple Factions in Fallout You Can join or refuse. Playing the game mirrors the experience of watching a Sci-Fi B-movie.The Fallout TV series continues from Fallout 4, but it's more like a spin-off story, some includes references from previous titles in the Fallout franchise. Featuring three main characters: Lucy the Vault Dweller, Maximus the Brotherhood Of Steel, and The Ghouls, along with CX404, each the character has their own story before and after the nuclear disaster strike. Everything in this TV series captures vibes similar to the video game, with outstanding cinematography showcasing the haunting beauty of apocalyptic Los Angeles in every location. The story so far has been Amazing and Enjoyable to watch, especially with its inclusion of Dark comedy executed skillfully, akin to the humor seen in Fallout franchise.",10
"Looks good, didn't feel good","Adapting a video game is always tough, but this series does it very well. Every scene looks amazing and seemingly stays true to the spirit of the game.The first episode had me hooked. Lucy and Ghoul introduced (both great characters) and the action after the wedding was awesome. And then....Every scene in the vault was absolutely dreadful to get through once Lucy leaves it. Watching freakin Rico from Hannah Montana suspiciously and somberly walk around for 7 episodes was ridiculous. The humor from Lucy's cousin & other leaders of the vault was awful.Finn, I mean Maximus, was unbearably boring of a character. They really forced a love connection between him and Lucy and really just copied Finn's story from Star Wars.Scenes just went on way too long. Every flashback with Walton Coggins and his wife was just too long and rather boring. The reveal that Lucy's dad was actually bad was very bad. The acting from Lucy was great, but I really don't need 2 full mins of her sad face reacting to the news and her dad pleading in the cage that it wasn't true.The cameos just seemed mid as well. Why have Fred Armisen and not do anything funny in his scene. Matt Berry could have been utilized better too.Idk it just really annoyed me more than I enjoyed it. Giving it props for looking so good though and really enjoyed Lucy as a character & the actress. Walton Coggins of course always killing it.If this tells me one thing, BIOSHOCK SERIES NEEDS TO HAPPEN.",4
Intelligent imaginative gripping entertainment.,"Some of the symbolism in this story is brilliant, the expansion of human nature into the grim and violent portrayals in characters we all know deep down. How many of us would be killers , how many cowards? And the bunker society is wonderful, the naivity , the innocence and the denial so accurate. The cowboy zombie fighting to keep his humanity and the mutant gulpers just great ideas. I'm not a gamer and just watched this for entertainment and was gripped from the first minute to the last, I might have ot try the game now! Please do a season two.I also really enjoyed the way the dog touched the human inside the goul. Flashbacks which can be so annoying or spoiling where not , they are just right giving the back story jas needed.",9
player.setlevel 9,"The Good: the acting was solid, the sets pull you in. In a few of the scenes I could taste the dust and grime. If you didn't know the lore, the characters are able to fill you in without that annoying info dump that's so prevalent in film & TV these days. The series adds to the lore of the games & has a few surprises for fans. I'm not a fan of Easter Eggs being shoved in, but the eggs on the show felt natural and not shoved in for member-berry bait, like: ready player nostalgia. Lucy is a decent fish-out-of-water and not just a girl boss. Cooper Howard/The Ghoul has a lot of charisma.The bad: my opinion of maximus is mixed. He came off as either insufferable or compelling. He's definitely an upgrade from Star Wars Finn. The romance between Lucy & maximus seems forced. The humor is a bit cringe worthy at times, but tolerable.The ugly: I'd recommend this series. Keep in mind that the series central theme is: nothing is as it seems.",9
Loved this show,"Whether you play the games or not, you can still walk away loving the show. The aesthetics, the lore, the easter eggs, and nods, all just combine into an awesome show. Loved every second and couldn't wait to get right into the next episode each time.The first episode made my jaw drop half way through and I had to text some buddies to get them to watch too. It was funny and tense the whole time.I can honestly say I was disappointed that there were only 8 episodes. I hope they come out with many more and if they do I'm excited to see where the series goes from here.Cooper is definitely my favorite character alongside Dogmeat. I can't wait for more!",10
Not may series have activated my attention but,"This one did for sure. Couldn't wait for the next episode. Played almost all the games in the last 15 year and was quite impressed with acting and storyline. Well done and awesome actors. I feel the directors made a great depiction of the Fallout word and the transitions between story lines appropriately. Some scenes seem a little drawn out and need more backstories. I imagine this is the goal, seeming vague is merely the story unfolding. I really hope this series keeps moving forward and continues its unique and dark tone. Regardless I will be watching every episode on season 2 and forward! Fallout!",9
A very well-made adaption with a great cast,"Excellent writing, the different bits and pieces were connected to bring a satisfying ending. (Very) good character development, mystery, etc. To be honest, I didn't have high expectations, but I felt a deep respect for the game. It's a wonderful drama.Also the motivations and/or the situations of the various characters can be quite complicated. Definitely a very well-made adaption with a great cast. Entire cast felt on point, suitable amount of humor at the right moments, gory and violent as hell, intriguing storyline, and so many fun easter eggs for fans. They understood the assignmentI wasn't a fan of the ending, but I enjoyed it overall.",8
A+ they nailed it,"So glad they didn't go a bloodless ""Disney"" route and stayed true to the game. I played probably 1000 hours of fallout 4 but even a person with 0 hours would love this. And I love that it was dropped all at once! Binge weekend yeehaw!The costumes, the language, the weirdness, the culture... many elements of this game were brought to the screen beautifully. I so wish they make a fallout 5 but I fear I will not have the time like I did before! Truth is I play games now wishing they had a survivor mode. Okay I'm just filling in characters to get to the 300 minimum now. Almost there. Enjoy the show!",10
Perfect Adaptation,"Everything from the set design, costumes, characters, and story was -chef's kiss-. It honestly felt like the actual game. I'm hoping in future seasons we'll see more of the various factions and monsters throughout the wasteland. Was hoping to see a deathclaw or two. Also since this is about 10 years after Fallout 4 the potential to hear about or see characters from it is huge.My only issue with the show, and it's teeny tiny, is they never actually explained how Moldova came to be in the future. As it doesn't seem like she was associated with Vault-Tech and she is about the same age she was in 2077. Maybe I missed that part, I'm not sure.",10
Man... That was rough...,"The show was everything I hoped it wouldn't be. The tone is too light, the writing is predictable, the characters are bland, the world is too clean, etc.. I know a lot of passionate people put a lot into this, but it just feels like the only Fallout they played was 4. I really wish I could like this show, but honestly can't recommend it with its ""by the numbers"" writing style and tone deaf approach to a beloved series.I really was hoping they'd capture what made 1, 2, 3, and New Vegas great. The soul crushing wasteland and atmosphere is not there. It's a comedy with some light drama thrown in at the end of the day.",1
Top tier post apocalyptic entertainment,"You don't need to have payed the games or really know anything about them. The only thing game knowledge adds are some ""dang that's from the game, so cool"" moments."" Playing the game only adds to the experience but not knowing the games doesn't take anything away from the overall entertainment and quality. Fallout stands on its own as a top tier post apocalyptic action drama. It's like Mad Max Fury Road meets The Road meets The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This series of episodes is up ther with any beloved action/Sci-Fi trilogies and is better than some. The creative team clearly took advantage of, what I imagine was, a very large budget. Nothing about his series feels like TV.",10
MUST WATCH! Best show based on a video game hands down!,"Follows the video games very well. Awesome story line and action packed. Costumes and props are great. Characters look just like in the game as well as costumes. I have been looking forward to this for a long time and I haven't been disappointed. If your into constant action with gore and violence this is definitely for you. The actors and actresses do a wonderful job and nothing feels fake or is bad acting. The guns, pip-boy computers and power armor suits are awesome! If you like this show you NEED to play the video game. I looking forward to more episodes. If you like video game based shows or are on the fence about watching it, do it you won't regret it.",10
Incredible!!,"I rarely write reviews, but this absolutely deserves one. I'm completely blown away by this series, every episode has gone from strength to strength and finishing with an epic climax. Everything in this series was spot on for me, they've captured the essences of Fallout perfectly!! Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins were brilliant and loved their characters.Over the years we've had gaming adaptations that have been poor at best to the absolutely shockers to date (Halo, Resident Evil Welcome to Racoon City and Resident the series) Fallout has set the bar now and this is what a gaming true gaming adaptation looks like. Hats off to the whole cast and geniuses behind the story.",10
Its surprisingly good.,"I'm currently on episode 3 and when I started I was praying and hoping Amazon did not ruin Fallout, but to my surprise I like it so far. It's FALLOUT!!!!I've played all Fallout games and seeing all the gore, the BOS, a Yao Guai, giant cockroach, and a Ghoul in the first episodes makes me want to reinstall all of the Fallout games and just play again, even the Bobbleheads made me smile.They could've ruined Fallout, but they kept it Fallout. The weapons are there, laser rifle, Automated Turret the Assaultron even Codsworth, well kinda.Amazon kept every detail according to the game and that's why the show is good, did they follow the Fallout storylines? No, but following trying to recreate the story exactly would've messed things up, so it's something new and I like it.",9
10/10 rads I recommend this masterpiece to everyone,"Fallout on Amazon Prime is what the gold standard of video game based cinema should be, it delivers an incredibly entertaining experience for fans immersed in the captivating universe, making it an ideal watch for both seasoned enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Sharing this journey with my girlfriend, with a couple of Nuka-Colas in hand, heightened the experience as we marveled at the meticulous attention to detail that remained faithful to the source material. Each moment brimmed with excitement, blending nostalgia with an original narrative that kept us engaged throughout. It felt like a heartfelt homage to loyal fans while extending a warm invitation to newcomers, welcoming them into the franchise with open arms. Whether you're a long-time devotee or just stepping into the wasteland, Fallout promises a satisfying and exhilarating experience that will leave you craving more.",10
Long time fan,"All I can say is wow I enjoyed it so much. Yes there were a few not very lore accurate moments, but man this is done so well. Hyping myself up since 2020 this exceeded my expectations. Amazon has been hitting it so well in the tv show scene it's awesome. The show made me want to play fallout 3 and new vegas again because there were so many homages. All of the small details had me pausing the show every now and then just to check out the scene. Also DOG MEAT! I may do another closer watch through to try and apot a mysterious stranger? That would be a really good hidden feature if it's there. War never changes.",10
Best TV series in a long time,"I am a fan of sci fi movies in general and I have enjoyed many from classicals like The Expanse to unconventional like The Boys. I have never played Fallout, as I did not have the time to do it. Therefore I didn't know the story and the show got me hooked from the first minute to the last. I can't even imagine how did Amazon release all the episodes at once, as the series have everything for addiction and more: great characters, fantastic mood, retro futuristic steam-punk sets up to the tiniest detail, excellent script which always brings a surprise, post nuclear world with a touch of western movies, fine humor. Every piece fits without feeling too forced and leaves you wanting for more. For me it was a very nice surprise and made me put Fallout 4 and Metro Exodus on my bucket list.",10
"Was looking forward to seeing Goggins, but this was not for me.","So let's start by stating that I've never played the games so I'm writing this as someone who is coming in cold to this world and these characters.I thought that I could watch Walton Goggins in anything, but after half of one episode then had to revise that idea.These observations are mild spoilers for the first half hour, but not for the season.So, the first five minutes where nobody in the house notices the intense flash of a nuclear bomb detonating was odd since it was pretty damned bright.Then a raid where the victims were still reacting with surprise 5 minutes after it started.Then another few scenes in a training camp leading up to a completely baffling promotion.Finally some poorly scripted cartoon like villains digging up Goggins.Maybe there's a reason that this seemed so poorly written and directed that fans of the game might understand, but it seemed like a very amateurish attempt to wring something from a bit of gore and a bit of lore that has completely escaped me.Shame, because I'm a big fan of cartoon like gore and also science fiction.Maybe this will do it for you but it certainly didn't do anything for me.",4
TV series masterfully captures the essence of the game.,"The Fallout TV adaptation is, without a doubt, the best I've ever seen! The cast is exceptional, the visual effects are stunning, and the script is faithful to the game's universe. As a die-hard fan, I can safely say that this series has exceeded all my expectations.It's true that if there was anything to criticize, I would be the first to point it out. But in this case, there is simply nothing to complain about. The series is perfect in every way.I can't wait for the next seasons, which I hope will be even longer and more epic than the first. I highly recommend Fallout to everyone, especially fans of the franchise. It's a must-watch series that masterfully captures the essence of the game.",10
Everything I hoped for and more as a longtimeFallout Fan,"I've been a Fallout fan for half of my life, first picking up Fallout 3 not too long after launch and falling in love with the lore, the universe, the characters, and the aesthetic. From that first step out moment exiting the Vault and the world below opening up down the hill from the scenic overlook this series has grabbed hold of me and not let go. From New Vegas, to Fallout 4 and Fallout 76, from the TTRPG board games....to fan films, comics and podcasts there is nothing like Fallout. So how do you adapt it in a way that works? How do you satisfy fans while also introducing the world of Fallout to a whole new generation and non-gamers?Like this. From the opening moments to the very last scene of a very, very familiar place I love that we're going in Season I loved every moment of it. The way in which they perfectly captured the layout and design of vaults, to the game meta, the dark humor it was beat of beat like watching someone play Fallout 5. Walton Goggins...that absolute unit of an actor was a power force in this, eating up every single scene he was in. Nolan knew the assignment, very clearly having a deep love of the games having played them himself. The ensemble cast of this was so, so well chosen...the music was perfectly on point.They nailed the set design, the world aesthetic, the unique meta experience of the gamer. The music slapped, the opening and closing credits were uniquely artistic and stunning. We get a HUGE teaser at the end of Episode 8 in terms of where we're going for Season 2. I'm fully onboard. Can't wait to see what awaits us.For me, this is one of the best video game adaptations I have ever seen. Thank you. This has also relit the fires of the entire Fallout fandom...no small feat.",10
Fallout deserves a 10 for its attention to detail,"When I first saw the Fallout trailer, I expected that it wouldn't be good because Netflix had already ruined The Witcher, and video game adaptations took liberties with the source content in what seemed like an effort to completely ruin them. Instead, Fallout makes sure that the locations are familiar to people who have played every game, that the characters themselves are appropriate, that the history is respected and that every detail game players had become accustomed to appears in the series. There's a hacking scene, a scene where characters get massacred in the slow-motion gory style of Fallout 3 and even the Pip-Boy plays a big part in the story. A video game adaptation could not be done any better than the way Amazon adapted Fallout. I can only hope that the second and third seasons of the series are as good as the first one; Amazon doesn't have the best of luck in creating decent follow-ups to stellar premieres.",10
Season 2 Please!!!,"My whole family & girlfriend who is not usually into this kind of thing is absolutely gripped by Fallout. We have watched it right though and went straight back to the beginning again. I have been a long standing fan and have played every game and it certainly doesn't miss.Every aspect matches with the game and has the same feeling. The visuals are fantastic and the attention to detail is second to none. Even the cars have been made to match with the game. Lucy is great and you can get a real connection with her character, same with the ghoul. Maximus i'm on the fence with but I believe he may be hiding a secret and that is why he's so odd. We shall see...Give it a watch you will not be disappointed. Bring on season 2 please!!!!",10
Fun & Entertaining. Will Likely Re-Watch.,"I haven't played the games, and I had a lot of questions during the first couple of episodes, so I would therefore suggest that non-gamers see a YouTube video going over the Vault lore before watching. There's basically an alternate version of American history starting around 1950, and in the future people will live in different metaphorical theme parks connected by a nuclear hellscape. It helps to understand that Vault 33 is a bit of an anomaly, in that it's connected to other Vaults and the residents are not all plant monsters or brain robots. Also skip the trailer in the mid-credits of the first episode, it contains some spoilers for the early episodes.Production was top-notch, as were the actors. A+ all-around.The brilliance of the show is a combination of how 'Fallout' the game is formatted, and how the show-runners chose to commit it to film. The game lends itself to storytelling because there is no ""main character"", it's more about exploring the bizarre post-apocalyptic dystopia the developers imagined and the kind of ""mini-worlds"" within it(the Vaults), so you can do almost anything by asking, ""What if there were a town where everyone was ___? What would that look like?"". Given that, it would have been very easy for the writers to lazily co-opt an existing story/characters, or maybe change the features of one of the core reoccurring game items for plot convenience, but no, they created new characters and appear to have done their due diligence to frame the story within the context of the pre-existing world. And now it's canon to the game world. Well done!Some people may find the gore and violence to be too much, but I enjoyed all the punching, shooting and explosions. Most of the jokes landed with me, and I appreciate the dark cynical humor that the franchise is apparently known for. I appreciate that the writers took the time to write characters who faced obstacles, failed, and evolved from their experiences to become stronger characters, or ""character development"", if you will.There were certainly plot holes, particularly towards the end, but they were either forgivably minor or things that can be fixed in a future season. There were no points during 'Fallout' that really grabbed me emotionally like in 'One Piece' or 'Peacemaker', which is fine, I don't need to cry to enjoy a show, but it's not a ""serious"" show in that sense. People die all the time, but the main characters always feel ""safe"" and the minor characters feel like NPCs when they go.I can't speak for gamers, but I had a great time with 'Fallout', enough so that if I had a game system I'd want to play it just to spend more time exploring that world. I'll probably end up watching it again in the next few months, and then once more before season 2 drops. It's made by the same people as 'West World', and 'Fallout' is almost as good as WW season 1, but WW also fell off a cliff(ha!) during the second season, therefore I have to remain agnostic on Fallout's future. Otherwise it's a great little sci-fi show for people who don't mind swearing and gore.",8
love the tv show so far,"I'm three episodes in and I'm loving the tv show so far it is just like the fallout games I love how they used every
Every asset fro the game like I love it every episode of it the pip boys and power armor are so detailed as well as the vault im looking forward to the future of the fallout tv and fallout universe i was to excited to see this yesterday i was checking the amazon prime page 50 times every hour and it was worth it in the end because
They picked a great story line and actor for the show they are doing a fantastic thing and I hope there are more episodes to come in the future #vault33.",10
Season 1 was OK,"I bought an issue of a PC magazine once, back then when magazines were a thing. It came with a disk, in which there were demos for several games and a full version of Fallout 2! That was my first introduction to the Fallout universe. My English was not as good at the time as it is now, and the gameplay seemed very hard as well, but it was also very interesting and I am glad I didn't just throw it aside and forgot about it. Instead, I found a very detailed and thorough walkthrough of the game and I started playing it obsessively while constantly referring to the walkthrough and trying to translate it. This game and its walkthrough are a significant milestone in advancement of my English. It has a very special place in my heart, but not just for that reason, but because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Now, coming back to the present, I was walking down the street the other day, and there were many billboards advertising Fallout as a new TV show. That was kind of a surreal feeling to me, how the game's become such a mainstream thing, in freaking Turkey, there are billboards advertising it! So, of course, even though I had set my expectations to the minimum, I had to check it out...Having become so cynical and skeptical(separate things, folks) about anything that comes out of entertainment industry, I cannot stress this enough: The show was OK so far, but it's just one season and it can go in any direction from here. So, keep that in mind, this is only about season 1. The first positive thing that I'd like to mention about the show is the actors, with few exceptions, but I won't specify the bad ones. I remember Walton Goggins from The Hateful Eight (2015), he was great in that movie and he's really good in this one, too. Ella Purnell's also good and very beautiful. Visual effects are acceptable for a TV show. Although, the physics of a lot of things like Vertibirds are kind of nonsensical, but in Fallout universe, I don't mind those. So, they really made a decent start, let's hope they keep this quality up.Now the important part, the story! I think the premise of the show is the most realistic part about Fallout universe. You might think that a lot of things about corporations and capitalism have been taking into a level that is too far fetched. If you think so, you might be consuming a lot of mainstream media. Take this scene from the show, where they weigh and throw puppies into incinerators if they are not above certain weight. That seems unrealistically cruel, right? Well, what if I tell you that chicken and egg industry literally grinds 7 billion chicks a year? They separate them depending on their genders, males are thrown onto a conveyor belt and they shiver on their way to the grinder. This is called 'chick culling' and you can't make this **** up. Also, look at the current wars going on around the world. There are literal companies that make weapons of war and then lobby politicians into escalating situations into wars. I don't want to name these companies or countries, because then this review will definitely get deleted. All I'm saying is there is nothing far-fetched about the show's premise about evil companies, if anything, real world is a lot uglier. Speaking about these companies, there is also something meta about the show, although it's nothing as nefarious as the things mentioned above, this franchise itself has become the symbol of company greed. I highly recommend a YouTube video named 'The Fall of 76' from a YT channel called Internet Historian, the video has currently over 36 million views. And it's not just Fallout franchise, they are still trying to milk their customers by selling the same game, ES V: Skyrim, over and over again, instead of coming up with new, creative, original stuff.These are my thoughts about season 1 and I hope they really go fully deep into that crazy Fallout universe in the future, where we can have episodes involving literal extraterrestrial aliens and even ghosts!",8
I'm indifferent,"As a rabid fan of the games, I am happy to report that this show absolutely nails the lore and essence of fallout, right down to the obligatory shallow main plot.In defense of the series, the lore of this world has always been the draw, rather than some big main quest. There is always a cheap excuse to get you out of the vault, then you forget about that reason for 100+ hours while you make your own story. So how do you make that experience into a good non-interactive story? Beats me, but I think they did it as well as could be expected.The good:
-Goggins' standout performance as Howard
-The interplay between Max and Chet
-Lore building surrounding VaultTecThe bad:
-Fights feel more comical than high-stakes
-Main villain is dull
-All the MacGuffins,
-Generally boring/unlikable protagonists.",5
I never played the game and I LOVE FALLOUT!,"I am huge Scifi fan and this series is just fabulous, the first seven minutes set the tone and once the characters were introduced and the plot(s) setup up it ROCKED!Shock, drama, great FX, great acting, thrills-a-plenty, tons of humor, amazing soundtrack, WHAT A BLAST!This genre has experience the void over the last few years, this is setting a new quality standard for this type of series. Hugely watchable, it's as binge-worthy as anything I've seen in the last few years. I hope everybody enjoys it as much as I did and I'm now going to watch it again, which I never do but this is that good.Best dystopian series ever!",10
Got me hooked,I never was interested in the fallout series. Seemed like a genre I would never play. Gave the show a shot and after an episode was hooked. Now playing fallout 4 and enjoying seeing the connections between the game and show. Really like the storyline with the flashbacks between motivations for the ghoul. The mystery was good and had a couple twists with some being predictable. I would say the love story really didn't hook me and could be absent from s2. Found Maximus to be unlikeable unless he was with his squire. I would have also liked some more motivations of the brotherhood. But really came out of nowhere for me 9/10.,9
Built nicely into a wonderful finale,"I've played Fallout 4 since its release. I go back time and time again. I wander around the wasteland, I befriend Piper, Nick Valentine, Cait, Preston. I save Abernathy Farm, you get the drift. I started watching with high hopes. Loved Lucy from the beginning, couldn't take my eyes off the charismatic Cooper, but struggled to like Maximus, he seemed so weak. The landscape, amazing. The vaults equally so. Power Armor, blue jumpsuits, they captured the lore beautifully. Just what I'd really hoped for. The series grew and grew, I started to understand and appreciate Maximus more. Thadeus too. At times violent, at times funny, even sadly romantic. The conclusion of S1, stunning, surprising. I found myself really moved by Lucy's mother for some reason. Was enough of her left to recognize her daughter, her husband, the man who betrayed her. But what a finale to a wonderful adaptation. Bravo. I look forward to Lucy and Coopers next adventure to find his family and wonder what Maximus can do with the Brotherhood.",10
Incredibly Good,"For those who played the video game (I am not one of them...) I'm told (by Wikipedia) that the TV series is true (and canon, whatever it means) with the games.And Todd Howard (who directed various games in the series and ended up in charge of the franchising for Bethesda) refused several offers before meeting Jonathan Nolan (an avid gamer of the series, they say) and deciding that his vision for the adaptation was the best possible.For those who didn't know that the game even existed (I am part of this group) I can assure you that this is one of the funniest, cleverest, most spirited and entertaining TV series ever.Ella Purnell is mesmerising (too beautiful... at least in this jumpsuit), Walton Goggins is the coolest Ghoul you'll ever meet and the story, although far from being 'original', is super catching.Enjoy.",10
What the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy attempted to be,"Honesty, this show is really, really good. No joke, by far one of the best videogame adaptations to date. I liked it more than The Last of Us and Halo TV adaptations-two game series I'm far more familiar with than Fallout. No, I'm not a fan of Fallout, I played FO 3 back when it came out one time and that was it. So this review isn't coming from a diehard fan of the Fallout series.I knew from the trailer that this adaptation would be a hit. What I did not expect was how similar in ways FALLOUT would be to the Star Wars ST. Lucy and Max in particular are practically Rey & Finn, their dynamic and core character traits down to the bone. But they're like a more realized versions of those characters.It's difficult discussing this show without going into spoilers. It does carry on the legacy of those 1950s pulp horror/sci-fi films. You can render the entire show black & white with that fuzzy audio and it'll be right at home.The characters are strong. The Wasteland shows how quickly motivations flip on a dime. How much influence people in power have over others under their charge, etc... it's all well done.",10
Amazing!,I knew a little about the video game but ultimately wasn't sure what to expect after my boyfriend showed the tv show to me. Turns out to be one of the best tv shows I've seen in a while and actually holds my attention. Usually I'll be scrolling through my phone while I put a show on but this show truly captivated me with a great and mysterious story line. I love the casting choices for this tv show and love the growing relationship between the two main characters. I'll be on the edge of my seat till the next season. I honestly can say I can't get enough of this show and would recommend 100%. Loved it!,10
Bloody brilliant!,"Fallout does an amazing job of capturing the essence of the Fallout games perfectly and the attention to detail is fantastic. I felt fully immersed and part of the Fallout universe, which is so familiar to me, yet had it's own uniqueness to make it different from the games. All the characters were cast perfectly and really were brought it to life within the Fallout universe. It has been adapted from a game to a TV show smoothly and seamlessly. I truly cannot recommend it highly enough. If you love the Fallout games or even just post-apocalypse games or TV shows, then this is for you. Watch it ASAP!",10
What is the point?,"I was seriously intriguied when I saw that Nolan an Joy are directing this, but what is this series about? It feels like a super boring adaptation of a video game. No characters to feel engaged with, just blood and gore and unmeaningfull dialogue. Sorry, but where is the fine craftswomanship from Westworld?The main thing that kept me going was the backstory. I loved the vault setting and the flashbacks, but the wasteland was just pointless, like an old western, but with the violence of japanese horror.Maybe I would appreciate if I played the video games, but as an outsider this is just pointless.",5
"Gruesome, Bizarre and Funny, greatest videogame adaptation ever.","To be honest I had low expectations and they completely blown my mind, this is a great new story to the franchise which is why i'm rating it a 10/10 they only used the core narrative from the games and made a great new story, all characters are well written. I love the way each main character has the 3 different personalities that you can choose in the gameLucy: Good Karma
Maximus: Neutral
Ghoul: Bad KarmaAlso, as a fan of the videogames I could see all the easter eggs which were great!Finale was outstanding, last scene blown my mind and i can´t wait for season 2, I just hope they bring us the 5th game soon enough.",10
"Exceptional, looks after the fans, yet supports new viewers","I'm a massive fan of fallout, and one of the things I really loved about the show is how it supports fans and yet is also good fun to watch for people who know nothing about it.For example, I would start laughing over a sarcastic in game reference, and my wife, who knows nothing about fallout (but also loved the show) just looks over at me like I had gone mad. Having not played the game, the dialogue added context for her, but not humour. Kind of like the hidden adult content in childrens shows like Shrek, put in for the parents who are watching.There are a couple of things that as someone who has played all the games and still plays 76 regularly you think, umm. Like for example their adaptive take on ghouls, but it doesn't really take anything away and is needed to support the story.Already looking forward to season 2.",10
They Coooked!,"I played fallout 3 and 4 fully. Some vegas at my friends house. And I will say this show captured fallout perfectly. Not much more you can add in the show for a season 1 without overwhelming people. I already know season 2 will be better. Mainly because the fallout universe has a lot of material to work with. We could see Super Mutants or Deathclaws. As far as the story. It was well done. Focusing on I think 4 different character developments. While in the crazy universe of fallout. They left good space to go in many different directions for season 2. I also enjoyed the many different emotions they took it. The show mixed all human elements nicely, Comedy, drama, action, slice of life. I'm looking forward to season 2. That's how you make an adaptation.",10
Compelling,"I'm not a huge gaming nerd so I didn't have a huge stake In this show being a perfect adaption, but this is the most unique thing that has been on television in a very, very long time. Of course, all the actors are amazing and that we all love from different things. The world building is vast and interesting and terrifying. Of course, we all contemplate the end of the world and what happens after the world ends but this put a very interesting spin on it because it does kind of put in your face how much capitalism is tied into every single aspect of our lives and our deaths. I hope there are many more seasons because there is so much to explore.",10
"Beyond expectation, but one plot hole","As an avid Fallout fan I was worried going into this but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the series. Is a must watch. Exceptional attention to detail and largely does resemble the Fallout universe and hasn't been watered down for a larger audience.However I did find a plot hole, LA is referred to as 'The Boneyard' in Fallout, and from 2281 The NCR (New California Republic) has control over the entire Boneyard and has made it their capital. Given this season is set in the year 2296 it would be safe to say that there is a bit of a plot hole here if you know a bit too much about Fallout than you probably should.",9
Best Video Game Adaptation Ever,"I absolutely love this show. I've never seen a video game adaptation that was with watching, but this show changed that.I played the games and this show does a great job with the story. My wife who never played video games loved it since you don't have to have played to enjoy the show.From dogmeat to ghouls, the people and places are just like the game. The T60 suits are perfect.Also the Vaults are spot on. The 50's saccharine sweet, mixed with the dark science experiments in the vault. The main ghoul is also a really great character. Showing life before and after was brilliant the writer wove it in together.",10
Only watch this if you liked Rebel Moon,"I know it is not, but it looks like a Zach Snyder vehicle.Multiple locations without connectivity? Check
Lack of character development? Check
No understanding of character's motivations? Check
Irritating music or score always in the background? Check
Lot's of action yet still seems boring? Check
Single thin female warrior who cannot act and you really to not care if she lives or die? Check
Story pushed along by plot device instead of cohesive writing? Check
Not sure who to root for? CheckThe only difference between this and Rebel Moon is that Rebel Moon took place entirely in a green screen warehouse. Here, the actual backdrops are real.",4
Quite possibly the best series of ALL time,"I'm familiar with the games, I never played them, watching this series wants me to play them so I can be fully engulfed in the Fallout world even more. Absolutely wonderfully done piece of cinema, I binged it all in one sitting and I WANT MORE!!!I have nothing negative to say, I thought everything flowed really well from beginning to end.Lots of amazing actors playing their part incredibly well!I can't possibly understand the negative reviews, even if you don't agree that it's not the video game, ( because it's not) everything was done to the highest quality.You don't want to miss this!",10
An ode to the games,More than a decade ago I started playing a video game series that would change my life. We all know it was fallout.It was a dream of mine since then to see a fallout TV or movie adaptation. But I never thought it would actually happen until it did.When it was announced had a small picture in my head of what the show would look like but it definitely exceeded my expectations.Christopher Nolan being a gamer himself and Todd Howard being involved in the series is what made me have faith in this show.And here I am today watching what I think is the best adaptation of a game I've ever seen along with last of us.Definitely worth it and now only expect the best for the next season.Shout out to Aaron Moten for his mad acting skills. Everyone was great but he is special and I hope he gets noticed more and hopefully we get to see more of him in more projects.,10
Perfect Adaptation,I'm currently 3 episodes into series. The opening scene captured my attention with the iconic fallout music. I love how the fallout music is spread through the show. Every scene really brings you into the fallout world. The vault scenes are authentic and beautiful. It's also fun seeing the in game items show up through out the show. The raider with the jet was great. The sand farmer drinking the emergency drinking water was hilarious. Great story so far and enjoying the mystery of whats ahead. My wife is also enjoying the series and has never once played a fallout game. Great job on adapting game into a great tv series!,10
Spirit of Fallout is Alive,"I think whether you're a long time fan of fallout or just stumbling upon this by chance, you'll enjoy it. I've been a huge fallout fan for over 15 years now, and the atmosphere, set pieces, 50s tracks, the ambient music, all fantastic. It's serious when it needs to be, dark and gritty, but interlaced with just the right amount of that quintessential fallout universe absurdity. The sets are my favorite part I think, there is so much love, care and detail in all of the scenes. Posters from the games. Models of furniture, items, junk, all lovingly crafted after the ones in games.And my favorite part, they did an excellent job of pulling from ALL OF THE GAMES. I mean New Vegas has several major nods, huge win for me. Rock-it launcher as seen in FO3, even a Mr. House cameo. They even have a giddy up buttercup just hidden on scene. I hope they take this momentum and run with it because they've really captured the essence of fallout for this fan, and I'm usually quite picky with adaptations.I'm excited to see more locations, creatures, people and factions from all of the games, and see how it all comes together, and I'm thrilled to see this universe get expanded. And I hope it brings a new influx of players to Fallout 76! The community is great!",10
Wow,"Watched just the first episode and I am totally hooked. I am a bit older generation and this really brought back some good memories. Long time ago I played fallout game a lot and movie representation is excellent reminder of good old times.Story is cool, CGI are great, cast is doing their job nicely and whole set up is exactly as it was in the game. So far nothing is missing.I am sure that this serial will bring a new wave of game lovers to re-ignite the flame for this game again. People who are familiar with the game will love this and anyone else who is a lover for SF apocalyptic setup will be hooked for sure.",10
I so badly want to give it a 10,Why the f did they choose Aaron Moten to be a lead?!? He sucks! It's an amazing game adaptation for sure. But he ruined it (mostly) for me. All the other actors nailed it. Great job everyone but him! Looking forward to the next one and hope they kill off his character! I'd love to see more of the fallout shelters and life within. Of course life on the surface is a huge part and I hope they show Megaton and the Children of the Atom in the next season. I was disappointed but I understand they needed to do a huge info dump for those unaware of the game. I was happy to hear that pinkofornia gave them the tax credit that not only should never have been imposed but was ultimately granted.,8
A Decent Show with Some Nuclear Hurdles to Overcome,"I'm coming into this review after having watched the show as a newcomer to the Fallout franchise. I know extremely little about the video games but am familiar with how culturally relevant they are in the video game landscape, both by fans and critics alike. As a gamer myself, I don't really find the Fallout games to be my cup of tea.That being said, I'm sure there are some things a Fallout fan might notice that I as a newbie may not pick up on initially, but if you want my short and sweet opinion, this show is very good, probably one of the better video game adaptations out there, though it's far from perfect. I love that video game adaptations are getting the proper love and respect they are long overdue for and obviously it's going to be hard to translate everything from the game screen to the tv screen, but for what it was worth, this show is something I consider to be its own thing and something that I can recommend.I'm aware this show takes place years after the games thus it has more liberties with its narrative while also being pigeon held by the game lore. I'm not going to nitpick it for what it missed, nor am I saying it's bad because it played fast and loose with some plot elements from the games and thus it's unworthy of viewing.I love the aesthetic, the theming, the cinematography and everything technical wise. I adore how they captured the post-apocalyptic retro futuristic setting so well. There's a sense of dread, hopelessness and chaos roaming about in the wasteland and each area the characters visit is so rich with personality, vibrancy and chemical fallout. I especially loved that they captured the dark and morbid tone the games had with that witty comedy spliced in to really capture how the residents and vault dwellers deal with the oppressive environment.The cast and acting are really good too. Ella Purnell really captures the doe eyed, naive Vault dweller persona really well in her performance and she was just a bundle of joy to watch. I also want to say I don't think she's a flawless character. There are multiple times throughout the show where she is mortally wounded, lost a finger, gets caught, and needs rescuing that it made sense even if she has some skills under her belt. I like the idea that despite being this goody two shoes and seemingly equipped to handle the outside world, the wasteland proves to be more than she can handle, and she uses her wits and resourcefulness to escape situations which makes sense to me. It helps also that Lucy is a charming character, she's resourceful, cooperative and kind but she's overly trusting, in over her head and witty in her own way.Walton Goggins is by far the best actor in this show as the Ghoul/Cooper Howard. He not only feels like he's a character from that sci-fi 1950's decade but looks the part also. His segments were probably my favorite next to Lucy's. He's cool but mysterious and brooding, but comedic in his own moments. I will say the Ghouls aren't supposed to be seen as zombies per se, but I think the show makes it work regardless. I'm not entirely sure how they're supposed to behave, so I could be wrong there.I think the weakest of the protagonist trio is Maximus played by Aaron Moten. He's another timid black male lead which is honestly a trope I'm tired of seeing in these shows, but even then, he has his own personal charm to his character. His hero worship of the Brotherhood mixed in with his growing distrust of them once he learns the truth was really well handled, even if I felt his scenes dragged on and felt mediocre at times. Acting wise he's a take it or leave it, not particularly stunning nor bad, just okay. The acting felt a bit stiff at points, I feel he should have been given better direction or been recast with someone a bit more convincing in my opinion.Moises Arias as Norm was also really fun to watch, it's been a while since I've seen him in an acting role. I will admit a lot of the male characters besides maybe Lucy's dad or The Ghoul/Cooper are very meek, submissive or timid, but in Norm's case, it makes the most sense with his character arc. I personally loved that we get to see the internal Vault politics, the schemes and machinations behind the Vaults existences and what happened to the other connected Vaults was also something I looked forward to watching. He may be sheepish, but I loved how cunning and sly he could be when faced with the cultish tendencies of the group he's left with.I like the callbacks, easter eggs and the attention to detail when designing the costumes, accessories and props for the show. The armor suits and the Pip boys especially are well done. I love how they clearly respect the source material, embrace the goofiness of the game's themes and don't try to talk down to you like you're a child so to speak when delivering dialogue.Now all that aside, I need to air out some grievances here and there. While I do like the story, what I think bogged it down to a eight rating for me was that there's an obvious anti-capitalist message towards the half end of the show where it's implied the good guys we're supposed to root for are not as morally grey as we think, but were secretly one hundred percent good and I'm not sure how it works, but that's what I got from it. Lucy's mom is barely a character, she exists only in flashbacks and feels more like a plot device than her own character. The overall grander story and lore was a bit mishandled in that regard.The original game, from what I've researched, was about the consequences of war, nuclear fallout, humanity's capacity for evil and the ultimate adage of ""war never changes."" The message of this show nukes that game's message, no pun intended, for this seemingly not so subtle ""evil corporation is bad and caused the end of the world"" plot. Frankly that kind of theme can be done well, but I don't think it works for this game's world and puts a black and white spin on a very nuanced and gray topic regarding humanity and the fact we didn't know who dropped the first bombs in the game's lore, making it ambiguous on purpose to highlight said theme. It doesn't hit the same honestly, I wished the writing had made it less obvious who we were supposed to like and dislike.There are a lot of female antagonists in this show which feels kind of weird to me. I'm not implying they can't be evil, but in times of war or post-apocalyptic settings, I would figure there would be more male antagonists or at the very least ones who are in leadership positions. However, most of the men, as I've said before are very passive, mopey, timid, servile, goofy, and non-threatening as a whole. I feel there's a bias in how the men and women are treated when given the antagonist/villain title. The men are one note jerks or baddies, and the women get more sympathetic motives or reasonable justification, but that's more of a personal gripe for me.Overall, the show is amazing, despite the critiques, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see it be they a fallout fan, newcomer or just someone looking for a fun action, adventure, dark comedy with gritty gore and wacky hijinks.",8
Disappointing,"If you're looking for a dark, gritty, post apocalyptic fallout show stay far, far away. Right when you get pulled in by the gorgeous set design you immediately get pulled right back out by stiff acting, or marvel'esque comedy bits. This is a ""theme park"" type show. Theres a ton of modern day messaging under a thin veneer of a ""post apocalyptic world"" that also pulls one out extremely easily. Bethesdas influence on this show is very apparent. That fallout 4 assault rifle was tragic. Over a hundred years after the bombs fell and nobody has tried to rebuild in a serious way? Shady sands anyone? Stay far, far away from this normie slop if you have any reverence for the source material.",1
My first time writing a review because Fallout deserves it,"Jonathan Nolan and co put their blood, sweat and tears into this. Everything has been brought to life to a degree I never thought possible. It makes sense that Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have worked together before because this tv series is absolutely the same quality that I'd expect from a movie under Christopher Nolan's name.From the set design to the costumes, the props, the scenery. The characters; The plot. Everything screams Fallout in such an authentic way.As a someone whose childhood was Fallout 4 and New Vegas this feels like a love letter. I finally know how Harry Potter and LOTR fans felt back in the day.",10
Amazing adaptation of my favorite franchise!,"I really was looking forward to seeing the Fallout show. I've been playing since Fallout 3, and I've enjoyed the world and setting since then. I was excited to hear a TV show was in the works, and have been optimistic about how it would be portrayed. I was not disappointed. Honestly, the most bang on adaptation I've personally ever seen. Most video game adaptations bastardize the material, but not this. Everything feels and looks like Fallout, the sets, costumes and everything in between. The actors do an amazing job, especially Walton Goggins, which makes me want to watch more of his films now, I'm that hooked on his performance. I'm looking forward to Season 2.",10
A stark look at a possible dystopian future,"I haven't played the game but aware of the plot.This a is programme worth watching for many reasons;
Successful game adaptation, mostly
Good acting, some great
A crazy yet believable dystopian future for humanity
It keeps you drawn in from episode one
Nothing over the top with CGI, which is a bonusI would highly recommend it, I hope season 2 will eclipse season one and not be a filler, like most series.I'm not giving the plot away for this very reason. There is no hype but facts.... butwatch it with an open mind. Discard the game plot and just watch the series.It will be a bumpy ride.Be helpful to your fellow humans, okie dokey 😉",10
Best Game to TV series ever,"Something every fan worries about is how true to the video game the story will be portrayed in the television series. We know how awful a production studio can perform when bringing a story from animation to live action. We all are aware of the first airbender movie, but also aware of the capabilities for greatness like Resident Evil, or Doom. Fallout will definitely be hailed as one of the great ones. Within the first five minutes you already feel as though your playing another one of their blockbuster video games. The writers and Director clearly understand the Fallout universe to a strong degree. If you're familiar with the storylines of previous Fallout titles, you will automatically feel very comfortable with this storyline. And outcomes of scenarios and decisions made will feel very familiar to the true Fallout nature we're so accustomed to as fans. I promise your desire for a true to canon universe told from the live-action view of this series, will be well satisfied in the first thirty minutes of the first episode. So grab a snack and a drink and prepare to be sucked in.",10
Critical Hit!!,"To be fair. I was wanting to dislike this because I thought there was no way it could be good. I mean, no video game adaption so far has been good except Last of Us. I put in hundreds if not thousands of hours into the games. To my surprise, I was dead wrong! Every episode got me more and more excited. They hit the nail on the head like a railroad rifle! It's got the action, the dialogue, the humor, the mystery of the games. I found myself getting so enthralled with the world. It stayed faithful for the fans and I'm sure will get new ones as well! Time to boot up the games again! And I suggest you do too! Time to journey into the wasteland!!And the final scene of the series...man are we in for a treat next season!",10
I have a giant tattoo of power armor on my back,"Since I was a kid Fallout series (starting with Fallout 2) was the most amazing and anticipated experience for me ever. As a game franchise it had it picks and falls but still for the whole 35 years it delivered a world. Not a story but a world. I was afraid this show just wont make it. Oh man I was afraid - this is something i waited for the whole life - a FALLOUT series. And damn - Amazon didn't disappoint, at all! This show is brilliant, delivering a nice story in a true fallout setting! I wont spoiler here at all, I just came here to say - if you a Fallouts fan, be there wasteland post-retro-futurism aesthetics or a dark Fallout only humoristic approach to a total humanity collapse this show is for you!",10
Is GoreCom a category?,"I mean what genre are shows like The Boys or Santa Clarita. They aren't Black comedy but there's definitly a comedic thread here. I tried to stick through the pilot episode but it was hard. When it was over, I felt relieved.I'm not a gamer - although I did rescue the princess once in the early 90s. My only familiarity with the game Fallout is what I researched before writing this review. So I won't fit in to the 95% category of reviews here. But most sites describe it as anti Capitalist - which is ironic since here in the present we're the closest we've ever been to a nuclear war. But this series starts in the 1950s, like the game, where people were truly afraid of nuclear war. It was a different political climate, to say the least.From a purely entertainment perspective, this show has not captured my intrigue - at all. The war theme is up my ally but it's just all in the background so far - a glimpse at the helos; some bad mf in iron suits standing by like man servants; a trans ""brother"" referred to as ""their"". The bloodshed in pod 33 bordered on comical aided by the lois lane dumdum who suddenly knows how to handle a dart gun and survives by luck.Speaking of Lucy, she gets a knife in her abdomen where the blade is vertical but when she goes to staple the wound, it's now horizontal. Is this sloppy production or part of the comedy? I mean, it's so blaring, I'm honestly stumped.Although I'm not fond of the character, I can appreciate the determination and sheltered but diciplined mentality. I'm hoping she becomes a badarse. (Also just kind of glad we're past the whole leading lady must be Hispanic thing.)The pilot is presented in 4 sections to intro the various groups of characters, which I think was a poor decision. Traditionally, a pilot grabs your interest by investing in a handful of characters. It would have intrigued me more to have shorter glimpses with more focus on one group or other. Instead, it uses kind of a speed-dating technique. No one likes those.The pilot had an opportunity to focus on Maximus but his interesting dialog comes after an oddly long pause just in time to almost make the 5 min scene have some value. Until then he seems pretty superficial. But I can tell he's going to be an ingesting character.To summarize: too slow pace; too much comedic underpinning; boring sountrack; immature gore style.I don't think I'll be watching more but I thought that about Wheel of Time, too, then it hooked me - The 1st season (2nd Season not recommended). Is GoreCom a category?",5
As a gamer not a fan of the game but a series fan,"With so many shows being churned out I didn't expect this to be as good as it was.I played fall out 2/3 and attempted 4 but I couldn't get into them and I'm sure if there was comments activated here I'd be destroyed. They just didn't do it for me.However.This show was aweome.Loved the multiple stories happening, action, not overly aggressive and the development of all characters without and nonsense adding characters that are just whack.What really made me stay engaged was the storyline, there was the announcement of S2 before the show kicked off which gave me immediate confidence. This is the real deal. Seen a few complaints like it's not as good as the last of us! Those people need a reality check. The show had it all.",8
Amazing Video Game Adaptation,"This show is a video game series adaptation done right. It keeps all the charm from the games with a ton of nods from things within them in ways that make sense. The story itself keeps obvious giveaways that many series give much earlier on and tells an amazing story with characters that feel real. Ella Parnell's take on a vault dweller that comes out of the vault into the harsh world is amazing and everything kept well on theme and brand. Lucy in the vault has aims for the best interests of others whilst also leaving the vault and struggling with the jarring reality. It blends nicely with the other characters, all that feel they have their own challenges and faults. Honestly, this is a must watch for anyone and if you are already a Fallout fan, you will likely love this. Well done to the teams creating this and the actors, absolutely amazing and makes me want more (very likely to go back and play them now!)",9
"Starts ok, but gets better","In the first episodes the main characters didn't do it for me, but rather the visuals and the setting/ambient is what kept me watching. It was my ""1 episode before sleep"" series. They really nailed down the visuals and the atmosphere, I cannot stress this enough, it was awesome to see the game portrayed so well in live action.As things progress, you start to find the characters a little more interesting, especially the ghoul, who was already better than the 2 main characters from the start. As story moves along, I start caring a little more about the 2 main characters, but it isn't until the last episode of s01 that I feel more connected to them. Speaking of which, that last episode was awesome, it alone is what earned the rating a bump from a 7 to 8.If you played the games, it's a no brainer, you should watch it. If you haven't, give it a try and maybe try to stick with it even if episode 1 doesn't help, it slowly improves and reaches its finest at the season finale.",8
Unexpected!!!,"I was very impressed with this show and how it turned out. I was very cautious and nervous they would ruin the universe when releasing this show attempting to appeal to new fans, over original fans, however I'm shocked in how well they managed to appeal to both side. As a fan of the series I really enjoyed the added lore to the universe and the live action adaptations of factions and creatures. However, don't get me wrong some stuff could of been clearer (e.g. The destruction of Shady Sands) yet it's not that big of a deal. But I watched with someone who had never heard of this series, but now are completely invested in the lore of fallout. I think all the actors and writers did a incredible job and I can't wait for season 2. Absolutely fantastic show!!!",10
Like the real thing.,"I've been playing Fallout games for 25 years, so yes, I'm a fan of those games therefore my review is a bit biased.But the show is exactly what I expected. When I first heard of this show being made, i had a secret wish that Vince Gilligan would do it, because his shows give the same kind vibe. But J. Nolan nailed it, it just cannot get any better.I seriously wonder (I guess I gotta read other reviews) how people, who haven't played the game, look at the show.In short, if you have ever been a fan of Fallout or you are just a gamer, you are going to love it. And yes, I still wonder what it would be like if Vince Gilligan would direct it. Could I then give 11 stars?",10
An Outstanding Adaptation That Honors the Franchise,"As a fan who has played Fallout 4 multiple times, I can confidently say that the new ""Fallout"" TV series is an absolute triumph. The show masterfully captures the essence of the beloved video game franchise while creating a compelling and engaging narrative that appeals to both long-time fans and newcomers alike.The series expertly balances the iconic elements of the Fallout universe, such as the retro-futuristic aesthetic, dark humor, and post-apocalyptic setting, with fresh and innovative storytelling. The writers have crafted a gripping plot that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, with well-developed characters and unexpected twists that maintain the spirit of the games.It's important to note that adapting a video game into a television series is no easy feat, and the creators of ""Fallout"" have done an exceptional job. They have successfully translated the immersive world and rich lore of the games into a visual medium, providing a new perspective on the universe that fans have grown to love.For those who may be critical of the show for not perfectly mirroring the games, it's crucial to remember that television is a different art form with its own unique constraints and opportunities. The ""Fallout"" series takes creative liberties to ensure that the story is engaging, accessible, and emotionally resonant for a wide audience.In conclusion, the ""Fallout"" TV series is a must-watch for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates well-crafted, post-apocalyptic storytelling. It's a delightful treat that honors the source material while standing on its own as a remarkable piece of television. Bravo to the creators and cast for bringing this iconic universe to life in such an outstanding manner.",10
Authentic and Accurate!,"OMG! Everything is soo good. From the scenery, to the props, to the lore. This is an unreal replication of the games. Great story, great acting, great adaptation. How much did this live action adaptation cost? Stimpaks, rusty cars, Super Duper Marts, all the food from the games, T-60 armor, even the stairs and steel structures in the vaults. I love how the secret experimental vaults are exposed and the corporate structure behind the vaults and the bombs is made clear. It's almost as if the TV series is designed to fill in the gaps in the game lore. If you ever played the games, this adaptation is the best you'll ever see! More, please... more!",10
Spent lots of money on set but forgot to get actors,"Had potential and had a great diasatopian vibe at start but wooden acting, very poor sfx and ridiculous storyline. Utter load of gibberish written by a 10 year old with a vivid imagination. Don't waste my time.They add the odd bit of ultra violence for dramatic effect but it fails for deliver. The characters are non relatable and I care for non of them. Loads of critical stuff not explained and incoherent. Stick to the games as this adaptation is a waste of time to watch.Got to episode 3 and gave up as it was painful to watch. Some weird 200 year old zombie with no nose who doesn't seem to get hurt. Crappy metal space marines who are dicks. Some innocent girl who's lived in a tin for her life who suddenly is Bear Grylls. Just weird, tacky and poorly executed. Avoid.",2
As with most adaptations of video games,"I was not expecting much from this show, the beginning was good, the middle was not that great, and the end was good again. Overall this show was a good watch, even with the shoved in the face DEI, the actors did a good job who were selected. Lucy though fits her character very well, her eyes remind me of an anime character (not in a bad way) it is unique and fits. I do feel the topless section of one episode was a bit unnecessary and didn't add anything to the show. I did want to see more ""things"" outside the vault that you see in the games, but I believe they will if they get renewed. I enjoyed how the season ended, good addition and not the bit least is the ghoul, without him, I don't believe the show would of carried.",8
Do you want to try Nuka Cola?,"Definitely the best video game series. I don't know what impression this work will make on people who are not familiar with the world of Fallout, but as an old connoisseur of this universe, I liked almost everything.Obviously this is a test season. Based on the results, it will be clear whether the sequels will be filmed. But I am sure that there will be quite a few of them. The Fallout world has many ready-made scenarios. You could make 10 seasons of the shelter stories alone.The story is classic for a series of games - something (someone) is kidnapped and the main character sets off on a journey full of dangers and adventures. We will be greeted by: classic-looking shelters, power armor, pip-boy, Red Rocket, ghouls and much more.And of course there is the bloody mess perk.Enjoy it traveler. End remember - war never changes.",10
FINALLY,"What THE whole pieace of joy. Immersion into this world one to one. Thanks a lot. It's truly match to the world of fallout. Even when skiming to the surface of hollywood's kandy picture, the frame is perfect. Director who create and support of this incrediable costumes is a gineus, no doubt. How cool watch, when you see not the flaivour of coulor but also a spirit of enviroment and perfect smell of digital world. Applause and admiration of hard work they've done i asume. Thank you, thank you very much. So many reffers to original items in the game some of those not purpose to match for reason to discuss. But again IT'S MOST TRULY ADOPTAITION OF GAME ON THE SCREEN EVER. Thank you actors, castand staff. You're the best. 10/10.",10

Highly accurate,"As someone with 600+ hours in Fallout 4 and 2000+ hours in Fallout 76, I can confirm that all the aspects in this film series are very accurate, from the pip boy's interface (fallout 3/fallout new vegas map and fallout 4 inventory menu) to the power armour making you mega overpowered (fallout 4). They also made the yao guai (bear) a loooooot more scary than in-game - personally, I would run for my life even if I had a set of x01 power armour if I saw a yao guai that was in the series, it was truly scary.Overall, very accurate with some very nice additions such as the inside of the power armour being iron man style.",10
Absolutely Brilliant,"My word, I don't think I've ever finished watching a TV series, and the next day started it over from the start. Until now that is.I was so nervous about Amazon making this, especially after the disaster that was... well, any number of shows really except for Expanse.But this is fantastic. I did not even dual screen it like I normally do. As a long time fan of the franchise (60% of all my gaming time being on Fallout), I worried that they'd either lean so heavily into ""member berries"" to bait fans, or be too low level to lean into ""normies"" and spoil it all with heavy handed social messaging.But it all worked out great. The main characters are very well rounded, and even the side characters work very well. No Mary-Sue stuff either.Even normies who don't play the games seem to like it - certainly within my circle, people who don't know a Stimpack from Radaway enjoy it.Thank you to the amazing cast and producers - you did a great job here.",10
Shockingly good,"I have been a fan of the games for over a decade. This show reflects perfectly the vibe of the games, while creating a new original story within the Fallout universe. A perfect blend of violence and humor, that is ever more unpredictable. Incredibile journey and final plot twist, leaving plenty of questions and knots to be tied for season 2. Characters back stories and development feel very real and relatable.And going beyond into unveiling many elements of this world that weren't explained in the games.I hope this enlarges the fandom of this piece of art.I wish to be frozen as I await season 2.",10
She Vadered! Nearly as good as Halo.,"Shiny lightsabers, things that look like things make me feel good!No matter breaking cannon or lore or even bad pacing.Modern filmmaking at its finest, as expected.Nearly as good as Halo.Seriously, how do you have a world full of amazing lore and end up with this?Cannon changes out of pure spite, washing away Fallout 1 & 2 and Fallout New Vegas. (The latter being easily the best in the franchise)It looks good, and some good actors, but the incessant changes just feel like pointless cultural appropriation.I'd rather play Fallout 76 than watch this again.Expecting this review to be deleted by Amazon owned IMDB...",2
"it is true, this is the best game adaptation of all time","How do you make a that makes the gamers feel like that they are in the game and the audience feel like they are watching a good show? How do you fit every detail every small reference every Easter egg from all the games in the series and still keep things interesting? How do you interconnect 8 different games in one story? How do you make three separate protagonists that are believable, equally interesting and not break the continuity of the universe you're making. This show has no business being so good, it's almost better than some of the games. The humour is sometimes burst out loud, the characters are fun to watch, Again this show has no business being so good. It makes other shows like last of us, threebody, look like child's work. Again it punches several weight classes above its weight. I hope season 2 is even better, cautiously.",10
"One of, if not the best video game adaptations ever","As a fan of the games, I went into this show reluctantly, while also being very excited for it. This show blew past all my expectations, and beyond. The opening scene grips you hard with an emotionally charged backstory for one of the protagonist, and gives new viewers a kick in the head as for what to expect from the show. With it's retro aesthetic, this show (like the games) stands out form other post-apocalyptic shows. The story itself is also great, with a good setup, middle, and ending. With the show heavily teasing a next season in its last scene, and credits, this looks like it could be a lot more than a one-hit wonder.",10
As good as expected from trailers,"As a long time fan of fallout I was Leary when I heard a show was coming out for it. Afterall, it has been a well known problem that video game adaptations do not always go off well. However, not only does it seamlessly intertwine video game lore into the story it also makes the world feel as you are back in the fallout universe. For anyone bashing on the show they are honestly just haters. Walton Googins plays a sort of mash up of Clint Eastwood from the GBU franchise and Henry Fonda from Once up a time in the west. The main character played by Lucy also makes you feel like she would be a genuine vault dweller in real life. As a player of the game her naive nature does not surprise me at all. Not to mention they take a familiar trend in the game and apply it. The one where the main character gets waylaid by other side missions before they can get to the main. Either way this show is great so far.",10
What's with the stupid music?,"The series overall is very good and the characters are played by excellent actors.The scenery, the story, the production are all good.What is annoying as hell is the over use of old songs. I understand that part of the story is set in the time of these songs and it would have been good if they put maybe 1 or 2 songs to showcase this throughout the series.But no! The producers, creators and God knows who else, chose to bombard us with multiple old songs that made them redundant and very very annoying. This removed a big chunk of the series attraction for me. I mean, what's with this stupid trend of playing a soft old song when someone is massacring others?Otherwise, I enjoyed the series.",8
Faithful to the Lore,"From Nuka Cola bottles, Cram cans and Sugar Bomb commercials, I saw everything totally faithful to Bethesda's franchise. From an Assaultron buried in the sand to a Mr. Handy in an abandoned Super Duper Mart, it was all wonderful eye-candy to fans of the games. The writing and acting was stellar! We are thrilled to see Walton Goggins involved as a main lead and Ella Purnell's portrayal of a naive Vault dweller was excellent. The backstory of all the show's characters was insightful. Now we want more!!!! I'd personally like to see the backstory of Michael Emerson's character, as well as Sarita Choudhury's. Kudos to Todd Howard!!! Well done my dear Sir, well done!",10
They've nailed it,"Old-timer gamer here (8-bit computers)
I'm always up for the latest and greatest when it comes to:
a: graphical detail
b: gameplay
c: storyline
d: depthWell, the FO series is something that only the greatest of producers/directors should dare to take on.Well, they nailed it.The detail is truly astounding. The relationship to gameplay has caused me to constantly pause/rewind the video to take it in, the story is of Bethesda quality (including the music), and (due to the story depth) I'm hoping/looking forward to series 2The acting is superb, and that's both actors new and established.Miss this at your own loss.",10
Binge watched the lot,"Let's start with my end coments first. It's a lot of baloney! After all the hype we heard about this new show, it seemed to be just up my sleeve. Unfortunately, although the scenery is good and lots of fighting between different types of people, it is not clear initially what this show is about. Probably one has to be a gameplayer to know which characters are evil, good or indifferent. Even after viewing all 8 episodes, I still don't have that answer. I presume in the game the player decides who is good or bad. It reminded me a lot of Westworld, though it is very different and not Westworld. But the people behind this series also produced Westworld. I expected a better show . . .",4
😎,"(I was required to type enough characters for this to count as a review, but this next single sentence would be my entire review if it were up to me)Whether you love the games or just love some good tv, if you're even thinking about giving this a try after watching the trailer, do yourself a favor and just dive right on in...This show is fun, gory, eerie, wild, random, and everything you'd expect from a Fallout series, and it's absolutely enjoyable whether you know anything about the world of Fallout or not. The soundtrack, sets, scenarios, costumes, characters, creatures, sounds, actors, extra little details, Easter eggs, etc, are all excellent. The creepiness and oddness and desperation of the wasteland is illustrated beautifully... and at times humorously, or grotesquely, or both at the same time!I hate leaving reviews, and I don't leave them often, I only wanted to drop a sentence or two, but I love great tv and great movies, and I'm by no means claiming this as a GOAT show, but it's pretty dang enjoyable and you should just watch it and inevitably enjoy it. Boom, I did it, blabbered on for the required character limit, all just because I enjoyed this show so much. I hope everyone else who watches it gets a nice hefty kick out of it as well, ENJOY !(Secure your future and the futures of your loved ones by putting down a deposit on your very own Vault-Tec residence, today!)",10
Brilliant,Absolutely love it this. Dark humour with great character stories and perfectly picked actors who play them.Brilliant sets. True to the game and attention to details are spot on and find myself looking at every part of the scenes for them. Really hope this is more then a couple of seasons. Gory and action packed scenes with an amazing soundtrack to go with it.On to episode 4 and excited to see the rest. I didnt think they could make it as good as the game but id say watching it is better then playing.Only thing id say is the dark or night scenes are too dark but overall a brilliant programme that is immersive.,10
The show is just as good as the games,"Fallout is 1 of my favourite video games series. I was really skeptical about a TV show since the games already set a really high bar. When bringing something over to a new space in a lot of ways it needs to be just as good, if not better then the originals creation. When Nolan said he enjoyed playing the Fallout games this was a good sign that he understood about the Fallout universe.Throughout watching the series, it was great fun pointing out so many things from the games. The art style was truly amazing and many things weren't redesigned which I personally thought was a good thing. Certain stuff was actually improved upon like the elevators, vault entrance and fire arms. The story was great and arguably better then the main quest line in the video games. Throughout the series I just wanted to hop into the universe myself. Explore vault 33 and the commonwealth. The series far from exceeded my expectations and I have spent hundreds of hours playing the games. Even if you have never played the games though, the TV show is a separate story and you will easily be able to follow along.",10
Good show but overuse of slow-motion montages to the point of ridiculousness,"Good show with an original concept and universe, paced well mostly, great work by. Walton Goggins is great as the ghoul, delivers his lines and the character's cynicism really well. Ella Purnell's done a fine job as well, lending to her character the impression that she's actually grown up in a vault, and lacks understanding of 'normal' social or ethical norms etc in scenes - good bit of detail. Aaron Moten is alright, but is a bit too awkward in his acting which can come off a bit inconsistent with his character and off-putting.The only annoying thing about the show is the often meaningless slow motion montages to random retro music. It is way overused and often feels completely forced and out of place.Aside from that it's a fairly well made show - they've obviously practiced some restraint and selectiveness with CGI and that helps - the visuals never feel too artificial or messy.",8
BEST SHOW EVER,"I love tv shows and have watched a lot of shows. I am a male and I love action and intricate storytelling. The storylines comes together and it's absolutely insane. Im serious its my new favorite show ever. Better than breaking bad, invincible, the punisher, game of thrones, prison break, shogun, love death robots, stranger things, and the boys. Those are just a few of my top shows and I absolutely can't believe that a video game live action show would take my new number one spot. The lore is phenomenal and the soundtrack adds suspense when needed. OR, it adds to the fun vibes to make the show more interesting at times! This show is very unique. It's honestly multiple genres at the same time but it comes together well. HIGHLY recommend!",10
Hardcore Fallout fan,"Fallout is one giant allegory for America after another. 15 years ago, that realization sucked me deep into Fallout 3. It had the same effect on Jonathan Nolan.The tone of Fallout is difficult to match: existential horror balanced by bleak humor to create a vast valley where any emotion can take place. The show gets it about as perfect as it can. It's often intense enough to put me on the edge of my seat. Every joke is funny enough to make me laugh out loud. These extremes open a space where anything can happen.The cast is top shelf with veterans like Kyle McLachlan and Sarita Choudhury and the impeccable Walton Goggins in a career performance. The younger cast, Moises Aires, Ella Purnell are perfect, and newcomer Aaron Moten steals the show with an extremely tense and emotional introduction.The plot is already complex with mysteries to be solved and political themes up to its eyes. Beautiful show. Solid 10/10.",10
Nightmarishly surreal sci-fi,"I haven't played the game, but was eagerly awaiting this series having seen the trailers. I binged the whole season in a day, and still wished for more.From start to finish, the show doesn't disappoint. The dystopian storyline is refreshingly unique, unpredictable and engrossing. It did a very good job of leaping between characters in different locations and time periods without stressing viewer cognition. As a result, the plot progresses urgently and there's no point where attention drifts or boredom sets in.The characters were well written, well acted, vibrant and relatable. Production quality and special effects are top notch.Pleasingly, it didn't put undue stress on interpersonal relationships or lecture the audience with political correctness - mistakes that have ruined so many potentially good shows lately.This is, for me, the best sci-fi released for a number of years - small or big screen. I was left wanting more, and will be impatient for a second season. Brilliant!",10
Fallout parody for kids,"If you expect this series to restore some of your childhood memories and atmosphere of playing old Fallout games than you are in for a huge disappointment. This TV series is basically a dumb, generic Hollywood excrement, only difference being Fallout aesthetics. Honestly, it feels like watching a Star Wars franchise or Witcher or any other crap that's recently been produced in US.You will not feel the desolate expanse of the wasteland that post-war US has become. Actually, it feels like entire action of this season takes places in an area the size of a football field. Main characters constantly jump one into another, especially when it is required that their ass is saved. And it happens all the time, perhaps the most retarded Hollywood cliche that should be treated as insult to an adult viewer. You will see main protagonists visiting the same few locations that are at the very same time lush green, wintery with halted vegetation and a scorching dessert (within walking distance from each other)The characters themselves are simple and extremely dumb. The only exception that stands out is the Ghoul that is played exceptionally well as if taken directly from a Tarantino movie. And this is what I don't understand. There is gore in this movie (it is Fallout after all), there is even nudity and sexual themes. This means the movie is suitable for 18+ viewers in most countries. However, the plot and characters are designed as if for kids and young teens. I really don't get it.There are other things that are extremely annoying like overdoing 50's music, to the point where it feels odd to view what is actually on the screen. There is utterly unnecessary timeline that takes place in the pre-war US. There is Maximus' childhood trauma scene that is replayed on every episode of the season as if we had amnesia and as if that should suffice to explain his actions and motivations. There are plot holes on every corner, to many to count, there are 3 main characters instead of one, the list could go on.I should've expected the crap to unfold before my eyes already after seeing Bethesda logo at the beginning of the first episodes. After all, it is Bethesda studio that turned one of my favorite games into a dull and cringe franchise. On the positive side, they could've cast Anna Taylor Joy as a main character, to put the final in the coffin. They did not, also Ghoul was cool, hence 2 stars.",2
A Really Good Sci-Fi Series,"I am not reviewing it based on how good adaption it is of the game as I am sure non-gamers will be watching this series too.Based on simply a series, it does a lot of things amazingly.The atmosphere, the storyline, the cast, the music, the cinematography, the direction most of these things hit the ball out of the park.As it is created by Johnathan Nolan, I can sense a lot quite similarity between this series and Westworld. The Man in Black is one example and Ramin as a music composer second.Still, it has a lot of unique moments, twists and character growth.It's dark, witty, violent, and sometimes funny. The actors did a really good job especially Ella and Walton.I understand if it lacks certain things based on the game but someone who doesn't know about source material, I find it a really good sci-fi apocalyptic series.",9
Now that's the perfect adaptation,"It's beautiful, the imagery, and everything! Totally faithful to the play, both in drama and humour. Perfectly enjoyable even for someone who doesn't know the game. (My wife is proof of this, she didn't even play it, but she watched it with me, and enjoy pleasure.) Those who do know it will notice the impeccable set, faithful to the original in every element, every little object, from the cake slices to the weapons., or stimpaks. Clothes, plunderers, and the various fabrics are flawless! The actors, the törtènet, every movement is perfectly created. The music and sound are of good quality and bring the game atmosphere. Now that's the perfect adaptation!",10
I give up. I'm not worthy!,"I've been writing film scripts for years. A couple actually garnered some interest. I thought I was, if not a great writer, at least maybe a good one. Had some potential. Then I watched ""Fallout"". And suddenly, I know the truth. Even if I had the talent to be a great writer, I simply do not have the imagination. Because I must say, I wouldn't have (couldn't have) thought up 7/8th of the surprises Jonathan Nolan and his writers gave me. Not to mention the inspired visuals, entertaining dialog and stunning twists! Add to that the brilliant acting of Walton Goggins (the best thing about the fantastic ""Justified"") and Kyle MacLachlan (yes, of ""Twin Peaks"" fame), and Leslie Uggams, who was a talented musician and actress fifty years before Dead Pool made her a household name to a new generation. Add to that a group of talented young actors (and an Eric Estrada of ""CHIPS"" fame - I don't mean the worst decision Michael Pena ever made, I mean the original 1977 TV show) and a video game with a TERRIFYING premise, and you have everything you need. This show is fantastic, and my screenwriting career is over. Maybe I can still write songs. I've been doing that for 40 years. After Fallout, it's my only chance.",10
This show is so good it's ridiculous,"I want to be as general as possible not to spoil anything. Just go watch it. It's really good. Seriously.It's REALLY... REALLY... GOOD.This show is so good and so true to the series I literally made this account on IMDb just to post this review.The atmosphere, characters, sounds, references and even the stuff they've added just SCREAMS Fallout. I really like the attention to small details, the high quality costumes and the CGI is really good as well! From the minute I've started watching I was hooked, I had to binge the entire show in a day, and it's such a good timing with it being available here on a weekend. I'm really struggling with words to describe how well made this is at this point, i feel like I'm forcing myself to write everything good about it but all I'm gonna say is, again, I really love seeing how true they've kept to the game's universe and it's aesthetics, mostly based off of the aesthetics in Fallout 4, but the show is just gorgeous...This show gave me faith in modern TV.",10
Fantastic,"As a long time fan of Fallout 1, 2, 3, NV this show nails it. ( I played 2 first).It takes place after most of the games do which is a great idea as it allows for room to use game events as history to inform some of the story telling while also not being constrained by trying to follow a particular games plot.The vibes, the setting, the costuming, everything is incredibly well executed. The lore around the vaults is perfect, the number of small immersive moments from the game, like the hacking of a terminal in the overseas office is perfect.The character writing is fantastic especially how each of the characters journeys come to a fantastic conclusion at the end.",10
LOVED IT! LITERAL NOSTALGIA.,"SO. FIRST OFF, I grew up playing all of these Fallout games, especially all of the RPG games by Bethesda. Shoot, if I wanted to, I'd restart every game just for the fun of it. Quiete literally.Now at the beginning when this shows 1st trailer came out, I was excited yet very skeptical because of how some live action and reworked shows/movies have personally disappointed me... BUT THIS. This had me watch the entire season in one day. Yes. In one day. It sucked me right in lol.At the end, after watching it, now I've been wondering whether this show was an introduction to a new Fallout game. Maybe? Maybe not. It was indeed very nostalgic and well made. Please give it try. I've read some bad reviews but I promise, it never hurts to give something a try.",10
BEST GAME ADAPTATION EVER!!,"What makes this a great adaptation is not only the lore is correct but it's everything. This show has great pacing, Acting, and overall vibes it's like playing the games. I will if u do not like slight nudity don't watch this. This show is exactly how I wanted to see a fallout show done. I was hooked after the raider attack in Episode 1. If this show isn't picked up for a second season I swear to God I will march down to Bethesda and Amazon myself and riot. No agenda is being pushed. Great twist at the end and excellent build up to it. Anyone fan of the games or not could pick this up and enjoy it.",10
"Not bad for a game adapt, but mediocre at best","Im a hardcore Fallout fan and have played through all fallouts from Fallout 3 forwards, and couldn't stick watching past the pilot ep.The show looks visually cool, but everything else is bland and expectable. All characters except the cowboy ghoul are unrelatable and annoying. The dialogue is bland and does not grasp your attention at all. Most actors are neverheard nobodys and don't bring anything cool to the table. The music score is overused, modern scifi-style drone stuff and does not fit into the setting. Wacky and uncomfortable humor kinda breaks the immersion. Most jarring thing is that every scene makes the whole thing feel like a Disney movie made for kids. Every bad guy with evil intentions can be sensed from mile away and character actions in fight scenes are over the top madness. Aside from the ghoul, the pilot episode lacked any sense of seriousness which I was expecting considering the gritty post-apocalyptic fallout setting.If you see yourself as a serious Fallout fan, I do not recommend watching this. If you have not played the games and are interested, maybe give it a try. Anyway, the best you'll be getting is a mediocre show with bland dialogue, uninteresting characters and predictable plot. Not worth my time IMO.",5
"Level 1 passed, we go further ==>>","Why is the Hollywood standard for filming series, especially for those who can offer unlimited content, persistently only 8 episodes? Why isn't it 20-30 episodes per season?So little happened here in the first season.The characters are naive, just like for level 1 of the game. For them, to be upgraded, I hope that another 20+ seasons can be filmed in which the action will develop. But that will cost viewers another 20+ years of waiting.There are also certain flaws for my taste, such as: unnecessary trying to be as believable as possible with the game and the acting that supports it seems rather naive. I also find showing disintegrated body parts disgusting, unnecessary mass nudity in one of the episodes, unnecessary brutal sex in the first episode, etc.All in all, a great series for the Fallout game fans and of this genre lovers.",9
"Catches the spirit, of the Games and the Humankind","I'm not a big fan of the fallout series. So my favorite Fallout game was the very unpopular Fallout 76 until now because of its great environmental storytelling which most gamers are just not capable to notice.But the series is a no brainer for me.It's a bit too much designed as a game like series, so Lucy literally in the first scene sets her character sheet by describing her skills for example. And within the episodes they always have some sort of Sidequest implemented.Nevertheless they manage to merge it with the main story much better than the games ever did.Maybe Todd Howard profits from this work with the show runners and learns how to design stories better in its games.My favorite, and I guess it is most people's favorite is the Ghoul Character from Walton Goggins.This characters gives the series it's depth from my perspective and it is always interesting how his story arc is going on. Also they used him as the Character that describes the world and the reasons how it came to this world.While Lucy is more the fish out of water character and Maximus more the Anti Hero. So they managed to give the series various perspectives with the characters.The world design is super great adapted from the games. Fans of the games will be knowing every single object and even locations. But they naturally build the world with it and do not try to create a new interpretation of Fallout and throw Fan service in it. Yes this goes out to you Disney and Star Wars.The dark humor and explicit violence is also very fitting. Although the humor might be off putting for non Fallout fans or general people that have issues with dark sense of humor.Even though the show runners claim there is no message in the series, they forget that the word of Fallout is a message itself and that's very anticapitalistic and also very critical to our society, which is even if they not intended it, very perfectly carried over from the games.There were some thing I did not like, and that is the plot convenience that is used throughout the series and even the plot armor. There is no real Gravitas for the characters at all. So they resolved many scenes with totally stupid solutions. In the game itself you can die :)I think it is one of the best game adaptions at all. The last of us was great, but it was basically the game without its interactivity. Fallout takes the spirit of the game and creates a great show.I am looking forward to the next season although I am careful with my expectations. The show runners did Westworld to and wrote it into a grave.",8
"Potential wasted by poor writing decisions, but good production.","Looking forward to a better result from a season 2 if there is one.Coming from a film buff who followed Fallout since the very first game by Brian Fargo and Interplay, who has their living room decorated in a Fallout 4 theme, who has finished Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and spent 1700 hours in Fallout 4, and who is also a fan of films such as the Mad Max series, with a particularly fond regard for Mad Max Furiosa, and having loved the films The Road, The Young Ones and The Rover, I can say this production is a solid effort, but fell quite short of the intrinsic potential of a wasteland epic in so many ways that, while it felt passable and somewhat enjoyable, it was largely disappointing. There is absolutely no reason a Fallout series with this quality of production and resources should fall short of the first few seasons of The Walking Dead, but it does. It just isn't as interesting and dynamic. The real culprit appears to be their struggle with bringing non-Fallout players into the fold storywise, having to bog down their ideas with the importance of audience-education about the Fallout world and the Vault and the Brotherhood of Steel. This was a fully terrible approach.The approach to creating a series like this should have been a more patient one aimed at the long-term, since, as with the actual game, there is nothing that speeds along with much success in this sort of post-apocalyptic world. They should have allowed the lore of the world to reveal itself long-term, naturally occuring along the journey of their Vault-dweller, but instead the typical Hollywood vices went to work here and we end up with them trying to include so much lore on such short notice that the series ends up looking more like an advertisement or glorification of the game than its own strong product. They should have taken an approach that put more emphasis on the survivalism aspects of an irradiated wasteland and the violent repercussions of human nature in such a desperate environment, particularly considering the license they demonstrate with violence and sexuality throughout the series. If audiences are watching this level of gore, nudity and other mature content then SURELY at no point does the overall plot need to feel PG-13, as it truly does, with yet another young adult-style plot revolving around daddy issues and infantile crushes. That sort of thing feels like it belongs more in The Hunger Games, and really, there's no reason to try to sell this franchise on a younger demographic, its strength IS its demographic, an entire generation of gamers who could easily influence succeeding generations of gamers and filmmakers alike with a successful production of this kind, but the series just barely manages to keep its head above water. That said, I'm pleased to report at this early stage that aggregate scores here on IMDB do appear quite high, currently averaging around 8.7. And there seem to be a lot of satisfied viewers, but we all know how the hype train goes, and I'm a bit to much of a vet to fall for that, so I'll be realistic and say that, after finishing the entire series in a two-day binge, it is passable bordering on strong, but far from masterful, receiving an 8/10 from me for this season, and keeping me interested enough to watch for the next.That said, it was a HELL of a lot better than the 3 Body Problem from Netflix, which was kinda hopeless by comparison.Despite a story that felt too much like a safe Hollywood action script, they DID get a LOT of things right.FIRST AND FOREMOST, MASSIVE kudos go to the young, beautiful and preciously tiny Ella Purnell, who was similarly excellent in S1 of Yellowjackets, the only other thing I've seen her in so far. Props to the production team for casting an interesting person as their lead, something that sadly has been all too rare of late - indeed films and series of the current generation seem oversaturated with uninteresting actors and actresses who, in many cases, appear to be chosen because of the this trait of being uninteresting for the sake of making them more relatable, but most often they're NOT more relatable, they're just more BORING (here I glare at the little actress they put as the main character in The Last of Us, who was literally so terribly uninteresting and unbelievable that she ruined the series), so here I'm happy to report, we have an interesting person to spend time with in glorious Ella with her big, expressive, beautiful eyes the likes of Mila Kunis'.And here I want to say, MAN does this kid they cast as Maximus EVER look like Denzel Washington! It's freakin' UNCANNY. He literally had to speak to convince me otherwise, but DAMN could they EVER cast this guy as Denzel's younger self in a film - you would literally be convinced it was CGI rejuvenation filters over top of the actual Denzel. Same eyes and overall facial structure, and even the build wasn't off by far. AND he did a good job and was interesting, even if a bit emasculated, meek and uncertain, as is the current vogue for the many male characters played beside heroic females leads are these days, you know, with the whole slow and agonizing death of any male masculinity whatsoever in a world that has apparently deemed any such as ""toxic"", most notably on the silver screen.Also notable was Walton Goggins' perfomance as Cooper. He does a phenomenal job as a gritty western-style character, basically playing a cowboy bounty hunter of the wasteland, but here i also want to add that they went a little bit too heavy on the ""spaghetti western"" feel with the series, though, admittedly, that sort of feel often does overlap the typical post-apocalyptic (let's face it, even Rick Grimes felt like a cowboy in TWD). He played a great ghoul, something I had been a tad worried about going into the series as I felt any sort of meaningful perfomance as such a creature would require very good makeup and effects and an equally talented actor, and lo and behold, as always, Walton Goggins delivers (I would say he's underrated, but he isn't - bro has worked in some very fine films, so clearly he gets the recognition he deserves; he's great as the voice of Cecil in the animated series Invincible too).They really nailed a lot of the visuals. The guns looked pretty good, with the exception of the BOS AR which was vastly oversized compared to in the game, presumably to make it look like it belonged with the bulky BOS power armor. The 10mm pistol looked great though, nice and hefty size. They got the Prydwen airship and Vertibirds looking great as well. The Vault Suits looked alright, pretty accurate to the most recent Fallout 4. Most impressively, they really nailed the Vault interior walls vertically and horizontally-sliding room doors, BUT... the main Vault Door, which was basically a highlight in all the games, the visual of which, closing or opening, held huge significance and was supposed to impact the viewer/player deeply (which it indeed did, to those of us who adored the games), even with so much design to drawn on throughout all the games, was a HUGE disappointment. The main Vault door, which is supposed to feel epic or monumental when being opened or shut, is just kinda ""meh"", and sadly, they even do try to focus some of the camera's attention on it, as if trying to make a bit of effort, and it's still wholly underwhelming - this is basically inexcusable, how can you make the graphics and visual impact of a huge production like this pale in comparison to graphics in games as old as 20 years or more? Oh well.The lone Robobrain was a tad disappointing as well, didn't look anything like the ones in the games - was more just weird, and more like a bit of an afterthought.We saw a couple of instances of the drug Jet, notably no use of the drug Psycho, and only a couple instances of use of the Stimpak. I felt like these should have been more prevalent, and, in the great cram-fest that was the inept design choice of the series, we left out entire CRUCIAL world elements and factions. The raiders, beyond appearing early on, were not very raider-like and were terribly misrepresented in the world, basically as scarce as water, in many cases moreso. Also lacking was any mention of the VERY prevalent cult in all of the Fallout games, The Children of Atom, as well as other key groups that flavour the games, such as the Supermutants and Talon Company. More understandably absent were any mention of the Minutemen faction, Gunners faction, the Commonwealth and the Institute, since these appear on the Eastern US seaboard, whereas this series is based in California, birthplace of the original Fallout game.Didn't care much for the plot or the use of an absolute wealth of lore and assets. It was good enough to be bingeable, and good enough to recommend, but not much to speak of beyond that. There is nothing as groundbreaking here as it well should have been, considering how groundbreaking the games were, games that have inspired many clones such as Atom RPG, Metro and Underrail (the former two are interesting as Russian takes on post-nuclear apocalypses), and it should be mentioned here as well, there is absolutely zero dispute that Fallout as a whole took a great deal of its inspiration from George Millers wonderous Mad Max series of films, and the games even include Mad Max's leather armor, and Mad Max's dog was the inspiration for the dog that appears as the only recurring character in all the Fallout games, the much-loved Dogmeat.Lastly, I appreciate what was done with the show in terms of embracing the whacky comedy and retrofuturism of the games, and overall the series represented the spirit of the games well, despite falling short of masterful storytelling and its maximum post-apocalyptic potential.",8
Superb Sci-Fi in it's own right whilst honouring the games world,"Over the past few years much of popular sci-fi has disappointed fans by moving away from the stories they thought their favourite show or film represented. I don't see it that way, different writers have told different tales within a franchises framework - but those stories have been poor or too preachy. Enter Fallout. No pandering, straight to business. There's plenty action & a solid story to tell. It does so whilst honouring the world already created and tells its tale with humour & grittyness with no compromises - A great female lead, a Ghoul, A metal man - how much more inclusive do you need (Heh). Seriously, everybody & everything is in here, they just don't put anything in to hit some stupid benchmark of we have to represent this or that, everything is in because it tells a great STORY. If only Disney / Marvel / Star Wars understood...ah, well. Fallout represents what is great about sci-fi - when you have a great script, a talented cast and the vision to entertain, great things happen. The show benefits from a decent budget and high quality production values making it must see TV. Cudos to Amazon MGM Studios & Bethesda for making sure they got it right. They deserve this to be huge so the competition could see how it should be done. If you haven't watched it yet, indulge yourself. HIGHLY Recommended.",9
Beyond My Expectations,"Zany, dark, lighthearted, serious, playful and most importantly violent and gory as hell. I feel this show really captured the essence of the Fallout game series.Stumble into a random building?Find a vault full of mutants trying to reverse their mutation that were experiments of Vault-Tec.Find a nice calm lake?There's a vicious monster lurking beneath the depths.Crossing a path with a few strangers that seem ready to be passive?No, they are cannibals and want to eat you.Psychotic robots that want to harvest your organs?Sounds like Fallout.It really takes me back to the experience I had wandering through the wasteland in the games and how I never really knew what to expect in the next building I went into.The acting was solid, story was solid and the room for future seasons? Set.Compared to other Amazon originals this one shines above the rest and the season finale really sold it for me. The twist, story conclusion and opening for more seasons, we have room for exapnsion.In addition, the effects and cinematography (one of my favorites was the scene where Coop kills all the BOS knights) were incredible and I am hopeful that they will keep the same level of quality in future seasons.All in all I highly recommend it and wish that more shows went to the same lengths this one did on being true to its source.",9
"Honestly, it just made me happy","Great adaptation. I loved the games and this show does them justice, while telling a great, whimsical, sad, hilarious, and engaging story in its own right. I honestly did not think that Amazon could pull this one off.The only reason I did not give it 10 stars is that it does not do the best job at building the world for people who have not engaged with the Fallout Universe previously. New viewers will struggle to catch all the references and understand what is happening - this is not always necessary, of course, but sometimes the lack of ""exposition"" can cause confusion, rather than add mystery and curiousity.The acting was phenomenal as well - This show made Ella Purnell one of my all-time favorite actresses, and I do hope we get to see more of her in the future!",9
War... war never changes.,"Side by side with The Last of Us in terms of the adaptation of a universe and a video game lore brought to the screen. A simple story that introduces us to a quite complex universe. Many well-presented characters that have a lot to give in future seasons.The staging and visual effects are impeccable. Nothing to envy a multimillion-dollar film production.""In the wasteland, you always deviate from your main mission for other things""If you played the games, some or all, you will find millions of references and many things and details that pass very superficially will make more sense. If you didn't, it's like the universe of Westworld. Little by little the answers are coming.The location of the last scene... wow...",10
Too dark and depressing,"What is happening with people that now we only have blood, killing, depression and horrors in every single tv show?What is happening with the person who is sitting at home, watching something so dark and depressing, and is like 'wow this is so good, i am going to recommend this show to everyone'.Every show lately is similar - For all mankind, Foundation (that started good and then ruined everything in second season), Baby reindeer, Westworld, Yellowstone... as if people are not satisfied with depression and darkness from real world but they need to have it in their free time too. I just don't understand
And i am definitely not a fan of this show even though all the actors are great.",1
Is this THE game adaptation?,"I thought this was gonna flop after recent TV show adaptation from the Avatars recent live action not living up to it's precessor, to the halo show being a huge flop from what I've heard. This show changed my perspective on live action adaptations especially those originating from video game backgrounds such as Resident evil and Halo. I should've known it would do better and learn from mistakes of other video games adaptations. In recent televized history it seems that Amazon prime is the only streaming platform properly using IP's with the great adaptation hits such as invincible, The boys and Vox machina. I trust that from this season alone I can trust Amazon with a series from my childhood very close and dear to my heart. I've put hundreds of hours into the fallout series alone and a 1000 hours into the Bethesda games all around. So I went into this being very critical as it's something personal to me and to my inner child and to see the lore and story being cared about and told I love it. THIS is how you do a Video Game adaptation. This is THE Fallout adaptation.",10
Fallout games come to life,"Of all the games, I have only played Fallout 4 and watched my husband play Fallout 76 (of which we were not fans). But I have played Fallout 4 an Innumerable amount of times over the last 9 years and it's absolutely my favorite video game of all time. That being said, I was expecting cheesy, bad acting, and a lot fan service but nothing of much value. I don't know why that's what I was expecting, maybe because people don't take video games too seriously so I thought this series from Amazon studios would not be given the attention of something adapted say, from a book. But I was SO wrong. It is so heavy with that unique fallout feel from the games, but it's own original idea, and yet still tying in with other details we know from the games, and adding color and value to the games for a replay thinking about all we learned from the tv show that added to the canon. The acting was amazing, including great detail to make some of the extras behave like the hilarious NPC's from Fallout 4. The winks to things or situations you find while playing the games were done well, amazingly wonderfully done fan service. And of course loved hearing that music I have been jamming to in the commonwealth since '15.I enjoyed the series very much. I did have a hard time watching the gory parts that are very much a nod to the games, but seeing live action verses animation was more jarring for me, a person who definitely doesn't do horror in anyway. I know that was to be expected in this series so it's not a negative, but something to add for someone who didn't think about that before watching the series like me, why watched it before bed and then couldn't go to sleep.",10
Excellent! Can't wait for it's return,"This show is certainly worth the watch! Way better than a lot of other stuff on. I don't know the video game, but this is a very well done post-apocalyptic show. Well acted. The scenery is fantastic. Very much a fan! Can't wait for more.The concept seems pretty simple. Bad things happen to seemingly good people. Pretty, innocent girl to the rescue against the bad people.I am a big fan of the post-apocalyptic universe. This one does not disappoint at all. Kudos to Amazon prime video.Walter Goggins never disappoints as a bad guy. I certainly enjoyed him and justified. Here in this show it is no different.Not as familiar with Lucy Parnell but she plays the innocent heroine very well.",9
Perfect post apocalyptic series to watch after a long time,The story and screenplay are very tight and it will keep you at the notch during every episode ending. The background story and the flashbacks are managed extremely well. I am not a die hard fan of the game but its a very nice adaptation to that. After The last of us this one i can definitely suggest this one to watch.Some fight sequences between the T60 and ghoul can be made better. But its a great show overall. I will definitely wait for its 2nd season. Hope they will continue with the same pace and show some more background stories which left lot of uncovered parts.and the timelines must be straight.,9
"Absurd, ghoulish, and a gory world that seem scarily real","This is in many ways great TV with plenty of absurd twists and lots of gore. The scary thing is that this feels real, like this is actually what we have to look forward to in our future. Kinda strange saying that since this is weird world with contradictions, and characters that both feels out of place and right at home at the same time.I played Fallout 3 when that came out, pretty good game, but I am not really a fanboy or anything and never played anything before or after. But from what I can tell this is pretty close to that game and we get a lot of nuggets of game hints, lots of funny signs hanging on walls and a lot of tech directly game related.Although this is based on a post-apocalyptic game and the show plays out in a ghoulish wasteland, I get more fantasy vibes. The hero need to gather a McGuffin and gather a team to go on a quest to find item A which will lead to the next quest and item B. It sounds a bit formulaic, and it sort of is. Probably my one big complaint that things move kinda linear and mostly one can figure out what will happen before it does. I could also complain about a few details, a few actors, and a couple of story-points are not hundred percent, but at the end of the day this is very well made, sky-high production value, with great music, and interesting characters.The contradictions with happy peppy people getting their limbs cut off and evil folk being kind and animals getting slaughtered in one scene and eaten in the next, puppies incinerated while the doctor save another puppy. It is all very strange, and fits perfectly with the vibe of the games and the vibe of this show.The first season (because there will be more) is far better than most things on TV today. Yea, it does not say so much because the competition is garbage, but this is more than watchable. This is good, even great at times. I give this a 8/10 and I am all for expanding on this universe. Give this a go, even if you do not like everything this is definitely entertaining.",8
A great adaption of the game but stands on its own,"I love Fallout games. Best going around. This series while standing on its own had many aspects to the games. The story line is a newbie but many of the old towns, buildings and people came to life. I enjoyed it. Binged in one day. Walter Goggins as usual is terrific, All the cast did a great job. Somewhat violent but what post apocalyptic world isn't. Loved it. Watch it. Enjoy it. Ella Purnell was great loved her in Yellowjackets. Well worth your time and maybe just maybe go back and play the games for old times sake. Hope they have a second series of the tv show and another Fallout game in the future but let's not wait 200 years or so.",10
Excellent work/adaptation,"This show was amazing! My husband and I have played all the fallout games, and this showed nailed it! The acting, references, music, storyline all fit and they did such a great job bringing an amazing video game to life. So many other video game adaptations fall short, and maybe Amazon/mgm learned from those mistakes, because what they created with Bethesda games was truly amazing! When you're watching the show, and if you've played the games, you get that weird sense of foreboding every time you watch someone walk into a new vault, because you know what happens in the video game.Another great part of this show are the flashback scenes with one of the main characters. They give you an amazing back story into vault-tec.All in all this is a great show, really well done, and has everyone excited for what's coming next in season 2!",10
What was that?!,"No...seriously...that wasn't a rhetorical question...what was that show?! I must confess that I only managed to put myself through three episodes of this atrocity before I could endure no more and gave up. It has been a while since I have seen anything this bafflingly bad, a big mess, a disjointed cacophony passing as content. Imbued and drenched with all the modern day ideological tropes and virtue signaling, bereft of anything resembling creativity or originality... and more importantly quality.I honestly don't care about the video games. I have no personal attachment to this IP, was only marginally familiar with the lore, so I approached this show as a newbie with no prior expectations. Therefore, I am only looking at this as a series, which I had hoped would be at least entertaining, containing a good story and interesting characters. None of that available here. Quite the opposite.A waste of time and brain cells. I'd like to say more but I feel my IQ dropping when I spend ANY time thinking or talking about ""Fallout"".",1
Absolutely worth it,"I won't lie after rings of power I was concerned but rings of power grew on me once I watched it and this was AMAZING. Binged it within 2 days, it stays true to the setting and is fairly realistic when it comes to the wasteland.Now I do think the vault tech story is a bit of a stretch but it is awesome, we all knew vault tech wasn't good from the start and this really does add on a whole new layer to that dynamic.Needless to say I think everyone was impressed from the start and we all look forward to a season 2 which it definitely deserves if it doesn't take another decade to make...hopefully.",10
Not a headliner but has potential.,"Last thing I want is to rate a show based on something I like because a bad review could mean cancellation so 10 stars it is. I'm seeing to much Disney influence in the story and casting. I would've preferred the first vault dweller to be male and funny, but hey, sex sells. Walter Goggins scored on this one. He'll become a household name playing the ghoul. Not many kids watch Sons, Justified, or Diamonds, lol. He's bringing more entertainment to the screen anyways. But we didn't need another Fin from Star Wars. One was good enough. It's like they cloned (ha) his story and personality. Another poor crying Storm Trooper. Anyways, keep the show going. Maybe it'll get better in Season 2 like Halo.",10
It's like a monument of future's world.,"While watching the show, I am thinking of that, how's about whole rules of starting of humanity remove this world ? I like dystopias universes but this show so clearly exhibit to the profits of factors without humanity so while this doing using some arguments, one of these is 50's communism-capitalism war, It's seems like, americans no have any problem except for this in this time, I think that could contains more somethings USSR or China. Other things there are some communities in the show but except vault-er, none of the others no explains of their history.All in all this show has a beautiful screnio and universe, definitely able to watch. Actors are good, the images are good and the effects are nicely done. Maybe if told of before the big war, it was better.",9
Best Video Game adaptation to date,"I keep seeing reviews here with relatively low scores. I don't get it. Maybe you're someone that hasn't played the game and doesn't get the show, maybe you were expecting something else. But I will say this: this is Fallout!I don't consider myself a die hard fan of the Fallout franchise, in fact I haven't even played Fallout 4. This show is, by far, the best adaptation I have seen on screen from content out of a video game.This IS what fallout is meant to be. It has the essence of the games. There is even a line by the Ghoul that says it's difficult to get anything done without getting sidetracked. That is pure Fallout right there.The music is amazing. I don't want to set the world on fire is a classic. The gore, the scenery, the barren wasteland... it is all there!What else can I say, if you have even casually played some of the games, like me, you will love this.This is my first ever ""review"" on IMDb and I just wanted to say that we need more content like this on TV. If we ever get a Mass Effect TV show, even if it's a fraction of how good Fallout is, it will be worth watching!",10
"Fun show, great adaption!","Great set pieces, music that calls out to the video game, great acting, humorous at times (just like the game).I have had a blast with this show. It does a good job of using the lore and feel of the game. Only critique I can give is the pacing can be off at times- but not enough to take me out of it.I'm not sure why people who supposedly played the game hate it so much. I think they did a great job of adapting the game to the screen. I put many hours into the game, and feel like they did a fantastic job of recreating the best parts of the game.I think people need to realize that an adaption doesn't have to be 100% pure to the source material to still be good. As long as it's well written, I'm there either way.",9
Perfect adaptation / sci-fi generally,"I can't think of anything missing. I watched this in one breath and only wished that it continued!It is always hit and miss with adaptations; typically, their greatest challenge is to accurately recreate the tone and atmosphere of the source material. Often times, only some of the crew really ""get it"" and are passionate, while others waste too much time trying to cater to imaginary expectations of the fans and mass appeal. Based on a trailer, I was only cautiously optimistic.I'm happy to say that the show surpassed all my expectations and was excellent in all aspects from casting to recreating the world (body past and future) to humor and art direction.Top quality entertainment in the sea of mass produced mediocrity!",10
Probably One of the Best Video Game Adaptations,"Although I haven't actually played the games, but from what I've heard from those who have, the show has done a beautiful job in adapting the games' universe. Fortunately, Fallout is the kind of show you do not need to be familiar with the origins of to enjoy. It is well made. The storytelling is really firm and keeps you hooked. The characters are portrayed quite good and you can easily connect with them. The humor is also acceptable and makes you laugh every now and then.The only issue I have with the show is that it would be much greater if there were some high points included. Throughout the show, from start to end, the show mostly in the same level of good. I mean, the story does not peak or a major event does not occur. The good thing here is that this means the show doesn't lose its touch at any point and keeps the good quality. You can easily realize this from the episodes ratings which do not vary much and mostly in the same range.Anyways, I really loved and enjoyed the first season and would love to see more peeks in the seasons to come.",9
Excellent World Building-Story Problems,"Reviewing a video game adaptation presents challenges. Because they are (except for Halo apparently) intended to honor the fandom and the original game. This series does that, to a degree.The set designs, CGI (except for the Gulp monsters), and production quality are all very good. And who doesn't enjoy a good old villain performance by Walton Goggins? He's great.Ella Purnell, despite the fact that she's saddled with a Mary Sue role, is also very good, projecting just enough ""fish out of water"" humor and surviving by the skin of her teeth as central character Lucy. Her standard response says it all, ""Okey Dokey"".Unfortunately, aside from those two there are many miscast ineffective performers, led by Aaron Moten as Maximus the renegade ""knight"" and Moises Arias as Norman, Lucy's brother. There are several small bit parts that are well done, but they are few and far between.The writing? All over the place. A lot of the overarching story does come from the game, but there are enough bizarre and gratuitous plot lines that by the end of the sixth episode it all begins to fall apart. The tonal shifts between overheated melodrama (the fifties flashbacks) to the hokey spoof of life in the vaults, to the Uber violent present day quests through the badlands on the surface do not serve the viewer well.Because they handle their roles well, the episodes that feature Lucy (Purnell) and The Ghoul (Goggins) can be fun to watch, until gratuitous weird crap starts happening. But Maximus' story is harder to watch until he joins up with Lucy, because Moten is so bad that it takes the viewer out of the story every time. His story is also so close to John Boyega's (as a defecting Storm Trooper in The Force Awakens) that his performance suffers in the comparison. He takes himself so seriously, and his expression changes so seldom, that it doesn't mesh with anything going on around him.Then there are the frequent plot problems (the all powerful knight suit can be deactivated by anyone who unscrews the battery/fusion core from the back of the suit. Really? Wouldn't the armor have some safety features to protect the knights from that?) that are the result of unimaginative writers. One of the biggest oddball issues is that all of the squires who are being trained to serve the knights as schleppers/pack animals are all skinny unhealthy looking toothpicks. Dumb.When you finish watching a series, especially one that ends with an open ended story line, you should be anxiously awaiting the next installment.Nope, not here.",4
Vault-Tec Approved Perfection,"Whether you are a die hard life long Fallout Fan (like me) or your introduction to the series is this show, you are going to be completely hooked. Chalked full of fan service and lore, it's a Fallout fans dream. This show will bring new fans to the games, and welcome them to a world worth exploring and delving into. Fallout 5 is a long way out, but this hits all the beats of filling that Vault boy shaped hole in your heart. Acting, directing, writing, cinematography all are firing on all cylinders. Intense, gory, funny, nerve-wracking, at times heartbreaking. There are a lot of words to describe Fallout, but one word stands tall, Perfection.",10
What are you lookin at smoothskin,"Fallout 3 is one of my favorite video games of all time, so I was cautiously optimistic when I heard about a TV adaptation. But this time Amazon and MGM knocked it out of the park. It's no small feat to adapt a game like Fallout to a real-world environment that is believable, while still paying attention to the little bits of gameplay that made it fun. At the same time, the writers were able to weave a storyline that is cohesive but also explores many themes from the series. Walton Goggins absolutely nails his role as The Ghoul, and Ella Purnell does a great job as the protagonist.I hope we don't have to wait years for a second season. While the finale wraps up the season storyline in a satisfying way, it still leaves us all wanting more Fallout!",9
Walton Goggins Better Get His Flowers!,"Great Goggins, finally something truly worthwhile watching. If there is ever going to be a show that reverses 'second screen' and 'scroll watching' this must be the template.Excellent character driven stories. Perfect casting. Beautiful set designs and wardrobe.Standing ovation to everyone!!The only fault... It seems we've got a long wait before season 2, something that appears to be symptomaric of Amazon shows, not helped by the writers strike nk doubt, but Amazon does have previous here: The Boys, Invincible, Wheel of Time (which is very... meh IMO), and their LOTR effort.Please, give us more.",10
Faultless,"As huge fan from fallout 3 through new Vegas and fallout 4 (multiple times across multiple platforms) to fall out 76, I was sceptical about another game to TV show interpretation BUT fallout the TV does not disappoint at all, the attention to detail is amazing, down to the chems and stimpaks all the way to the power armour and bethesdas comedic in game humour the show captures and embodies everything about the game I as a fan love and I hope there are many more seasons of fallout to come. Choice of actors was spot on, Walter coggins is the perfect pic, acting itself was just right and again captures the in game style of voice play in the characters in game, the wasteland landscapes and ""towns"" in said wasteland are exactly how you would want as a game fan. Honestly couldn't recommend this show enough, and it would also appeal to people who have never played the games and would hopefully lead them to then going on to play and enjoy the vast world that is fallout. Solid outing from Bethesda and Amazon's first Collab.",10
"I don't know how, but they nailed it!","Fallout is not just a game, it's a certain... tone. It mixes ultra violence with a post apocalyptic retro-futuristic satirical take on the Greatest Generation.It's clever storytelling which is difficult to get right. Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and Fallout New Vegas are the best games in the series and has since 2010 set the staple of what Fallout can be.With huge setbacks for Fallout fans with Fallout 76, and Amazon failing Rings of Power I had no hopes for this series at all.The Fallout TV Series, however... absolutely nails it! It has the exact right tone, pulls no punches with ultra violence, has its own unique characters and 50's sci fi scientific madness.The actors are all fantastic, the style perfect and the story engaging! It sets the tone after just 5 minutes and tells a story. The story of Fallout, no bull, just plain Fallout.This is amazing! As a massive Fallout fan since Fallout 3 in 2008 I have to say my hat is off and I will be enjoying this tremendously!",10
Amazing!,"What an amazing series. Me and my partner are both gamers and loved Fallout 76 and 4 so we were excited to watch this and it definitely did not disappoint. The attention to detail , clearly large budget spent, incorporation of art work and locations from the game were outstanding. A must watch for Bethesda fans. Can't wait for the next season, hopefully it won't be too far in the future. Really don't understand the butt hurt super nerd fans, please don't get this cancelled with the negativity like you did Resident Evil Netflix series 😭
Credit especially to Ella Purnell and Walter Goggins I found their acting to be superb!And Dogmeat ofc 🐶",10
"Scenario and secondary characters perfectly, but the two principals...🤦","I like to let my review because I'm a huge fan of fallout, I play it since Fallout 1, and I LOVE the history, characters and ambiance, so...PROS
the scenery is amazing, the ambience is also AWESOME 👏👏👏👏👏!Walton Goggins' ghoul was SO GREAT AND SANGUINARY, Fallout in his veins!!!The secondary characters was really cool too, the guys from shelters was great, the shelters it selfe was really great!!CONS
Lucy (Ella Purnell) is toooooooo silly, please see that I'm talking about the character, not the actress, she is great. The character only shoots with that little tranquilizer dart gun that never existed in the game (the game is shooting and bombing all the time!!!! They could have at least used a BB gun then! ), she's very ""oh my God are you going to kill this guy??"", ""oh I really have to attack this guy, why are you so aggressive??"", bro Fallout is shooting and blood all the time and she doesn't want to be aggressive?!?!?!?!? I didn't understand anything!!!! She took about 4 episodes and still doesn't understand that everyone wants to kill you in the world of fallout 😂😂??? Common it's not the behavior of a main character of a fallout game...
I doesn't understand, the series are very bloody as the game, but she doesn't want to fight, to kill everyone...🤦🤦🤦Maximus (Aaron Clifton), is very slow, please see that I'm talking about the character, not the actor. The fact of he doesn't know how to use Power armor is ok, but I thought he was too slow to fight, I don't know...Okay, I'll be honest, I kind of gave up watching it because of them two and worse than that I was drooling to see the series, it was a dream come true to see Fallout as a series...😢😢",8
Disappointed Fallout fan,"I've been a long time fan of the game series, but this could be a show about anything, there's very little that feels like Fallout, crappy corny dialogue that is completely out of place for an underground society that hasn't seen the surface or been exposed to any new popular culture for nearly 3 centuries.I had high hopes but they fell flat after the opening bomb drop sequence, and only got worse from there.I gave it a fair crack, as I watched 4 episodes, but I couldn't tolerate it any longer.Why are video games adapted to the screen so poorly?, only The Witcher has been up to par, and even then the second series was mediocre.",1
Im so happy now,"When i heard of this, that several thousands of gaming time would translate into a TV series, iwas very happy. The closer it came to today, my fears slightlu grew, what if it was awful and a mess up ? Today, i´m no longer afraid after seeing 4 straight episodes, this was even more wonderful than i could have imagined. The feeling was there, the clonk of the power armour was spot on and all the songs a listened to for a zillion hours was there, i have not been this happy since my kids were born. I just want to raise a glass to all of the perfect actors doing this so much justice and to mr Nolan för delievering a christmas treat in april. If you ever played the game, this is your show. And if you haven´t, you probably might like it anyways. Thank you Amazon!",10
Truly a Masterpiece,"I have to say, this is the best adaptation TV show to a video that k have ever seen. All I can say is if Amazon decides to do more, it will not disappoint.I am one who tends to not fall in love with TV shows that are adaptations of games. This one hits it out of the park. To the thrilling fights, to the quirky songs and nuances from the 1950's, it always makes one come back for more.The character building is done really well. The show takes you through each characters backgrounds and gives you snippets of their past that makes you come back for more. Moreover, the budget for the TV series is one really well. The CGI and costumes don't feel fake.",10
10/10,"-----------------------
By far the best gaming adaptation show I have ever seen. The plot was incredibly well written and executed. The characters especially the Ghoul were badass, the only thing I will say is that it lacks some of the monsters from the game, like I wanna see rat moles etc just pop out but hey this is only the first season (I hope they release s2 soon) so they could add more to the next one who knows. This show is most definitely up there with breaking bad on my list.Overall, 10/10. This show has made me redownload fallout 4 and currently now replaying it.-----------------------",10
THE BEST THING YOU WILL EVER WATCH,"I've seen plenty of amazing tv series and movies in my lifetime, but never ever have I watched something done so incredibly well like Fallout is. This tv series is just the best. This is better than Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, it's better than Game of Thrones, better than the Avengers, it's better than anything. Everything has been curated so well, the caracters, the scenery, the special effects, the script, the camera, the actors, the episodes lenght and format, the fantastic way in which they stayed true to the games and recreated the Fallout world perfectly.This is the best thing you will ever watch, and the only negative thing about it is that it's only 8 episodes, because I need another 500 episodes of this stuff at the very least. And you will need another 500 episodes too after watching it, you can trust me on that.",10
Give me more but give it time,"Fallout is my favourite game-series ever starting with Fallout 1. Never finished Fallout tactics tough. This tv-series stayed amazingly true to the feeling I love with the games. Will probably rewatch it next weekend.You get to experience the world again with fresh eyes just like any game starts. Characters felt like they each had their S. P. E. C. I. A. L stats suitable distributed and clear personal morals. Intrigues are both heartbreaking and over the top cooky as it should be. My fear was that the wackiness would be the main focus. I am extremely impressed with how the team balanced it.I want more, but I hope the team takes the time it needs to continously produce this quality. I do not want tired action-packed scifi western with one-liners. I want more Fallout season 1. Which is Great!!! Thank you for taking this to the screen in a manner that makes a die-hard fan happy.",10
One of the best game to show adaptations to ever exist.,"I'm not even finished with the final 2 episodes left of the first season but I still have this to say, it's amazing. The producers and show creators did a perfect job of bringing the world of Fallout to life. I truly felt the same joy watching this show as I felt when I first played Fallout 3. They stayed true to the world and gave us what we would've wanted had we had a decision in making it. They picked such a good cast, Goggins and Purnell absolutely killed their roles. It's an exciting ride and has the perfect touch of comedy when necessary. Gotta say, it turned out much better than most probably could've imagined it would. I'm excited to see more seasons!!",10
What a payoff,"As a huge fan of the first few games this show absolutely nails the feel of the game. After watching the show I come to the review/ratings and was astounded that anyone could say anything bad about this show.Each of the leads played their part perfectly. Goggins is fantastic as The Ghoul & as Cooper.They nailed the cult factions from the game while telling multiple new storylines.It was refreshing to see a show game translate into a good TV show. There were many twists and turns while paying respect to the games with tons of Easter eggs for the diehards. They weren't afraid to go to a very creepy and dark place on many fronts.Episode 8 paid off extremely well while setting up for another season perfectly.I'd recommend the show to anyone regardless of not knowing the video game, as long as they can handle some squeamish violence.",9
"Recommended for the average person, disappointing for hardcore fans of the series","I had to create an account to express my anger at this adaptation. I will applaud it on its visuals, but I cannot give a dime for its writing nor canonicity. If you've never played a Fallout game before, or casually played Fallout, then yes, I can safely recommend this show for you as, on its own, is entertaining and is capable of being a satisfying watch, excluding some of the bad writing which could bother you. However if you are one of those people who've been interested in Fallout's world for a long time then there's a high chance you'll be disappointed by how Bethesda changes Fallout's west coast lore to retcon levels.Onto my criticisms. I mentioned the bad writing, of which I can tell you two cases of, one in episode 1 and another in 2. The first problem I had is with its introduction to our trouble. Apparently Vault 32's inhabitants had been all killed by a group of raiders who then dressed as them and yet nobody in Vault 33 was able to recognize during their trading session that these people looked nothing like the original inhabitants of the people they frequently contacted for trade? And in episode 2, alongside with its depiction of the Brotherhood accepting outsiders into its ranks (which it never did outside of Fallout 3 and even they had a major problem with it), the plot becomes suspiciously convenient by having the Brotherhood Knight act like a brutish idiot and land in the middle of nowhere just so they could stumble upon the leftovers of one of the other main characters. Onto the canonicity of the show, its egregious. The NCR is destroyed, for some reason in 2277 even though it was shown in New Vegas the NCR was still alive and well in 2281. And now their remnants have turned into a crazed cult. Ghouls are, once again, depicted as being able to survive without needing to drink or eat, I blame Fallout 4 for this. The Brotherhood, for some reason, conscripts outsiders whilst simultaneously being religious technology hoarders. And they no longer act isolationist, this is not okay because these guys aren't some excommunicated off shoot of the Brotherhood, they are the HEAD of the organization.Seriously, I would've given this show a 6/10 if I didn't care so much about the original games, but because I hate Bethesda so much I cannot give an ounce of support to this series. In my eyes, it failed.",1
"NCR,ENCLAVE,RAIDERS,BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL AND NEXT IS NEW VEGAS","Will , by far that was the most perfect video game show I've seen in a while I was a bit hesitant about it after watching the first episode and knowing that the show it self is not taking it self seriously it was very light and gritty and captured the tone and aesthetic really good , one nitpick tho how would a scribe kill a yao guai in 2 shots to the head it took me a full clip of the energy rifle so what's up with that amazon , also the transition of the setting to the mohavie and new Vegas give a really good thing about what's coming next I have really high expectations for the next step...",10
Amazon finally gets a beloved universe right,"I was expecting this to flop. I've played all fallout games since 2, besides 76. There was no possible way the people behind Rings of Power could get something as nuanced as Fallout lore right, right? Gave it a chance because I love Walton Goggins. They blew this out of the water! I cannot believe how good it is, not in a million years! This is a much watch for not only game fans but newcomers as well! The finale was hugely impactful, when fans of the series see the final scene, they will go nuts! Please hurry season two!!!! If I have one slight disappointment, a very minor disappointment, it would be the lack of super mutants but I love the characters so much I'll give that a pass and remain hopeful for the next season!",10
Can't wait for season 2!!!,"I was hoping for this show to be good but i was mistaken, this show came out PERFECT! Man i cannot wait for season 2, i'm excited! Everything in this show was good! The music was incredible, the acting, the cgi and ofcourse the storyline. I would write a review on that but i think i would just end up spoiling it for people who havent finished it yet. In my opinion, this show is one of the good film adaptation video games i have ever seen, it was absolutely better than i expected it to be. I've been a diehard fallout fan for years and when i heard about the franchise getting a film adaptation i was pretty thrilled but honestly i gotta admit i was a bit scared, scared that this show might end up being sucked like some of the other video game film adaptations. But again i was mistaken, this show came out amazing! Im excited for season 2!!!",10
Best show that Amazon has made so far!!..,This is the best thing that I have watched on Amazon prime that they have created so far!. It stayed very loyal to the source material!!. Just finished watching the first season going to rewatch the whole season a few times 10 out of 10 Stars. Only wish is for next season to have more robots and more of the beasts of the wasteland like the Supermutants and deathclaws. Hopefully we get to see the Mojave wasteland chapter of the brotherhood of steel next season!?. Amazon should really consider putting more money into the fallout franchise and create one or two spin-offs smaller stories that are loyal to the source material I would even take a reboot all of the fallout nuka break YouTube series but on Amazon!!..,10
Cinematic masterpiece!,"Never played the games so i cannot say if its story is accurate. Nevertheless really enjoyed watching.Every scene contains cool shots.I really enjoy this kind of post apocalyptic type of series.The different storylines playing at once kept it interesting to watch.The Ghoul played by actor Walton Goggings was a perfect cast.The music choice was spot on aswell.Without spoiling the final episode i really am looking forward to the next season and i cannot wait until its release.The movie deserves an 8,5/10It made me interested in playing the games and the entire ´Fallout´ storyline.",8
Even though Amazon might be Vault Tec,"I mean, this show is good! The main character looks like a young Emma Stone, and it's literally like watching a game unfold in front of your eyes. The very first episode grasps the twisty tourney adventure that is the wasteland in its core. I've had to stop myself from watching it because it got too late and I needed to go to sleep. Also, I'm not one for watching a series more than once, but I'm probably gonna be watching this again. Luckily Michael Rappaport is only in one episode for like 30 seconds, because recently he's shown that he is only worth being in a show for 30 seconds. So that's a spoiler I guess I'll end with that.",10
SO GOOD SEASON TWO WHEN?????,"It's everything that I wanted from the Fallout show.It's beautiful. Every building looks like it's straight out of the game every chem, food (loved that I got to see INSIDE a yum yum devilled egg box!!! I LOVE THE DETAILS), clothing item, prop ...everything is beautiful.OTS AMAZONG I LOVE THE MUSIC AND EVERYTHING.I love Lucy's little brother so much. CANT WAIT TO SEE MORE OF EVERYONE IN SEASON TWO,VEGAS BABY YEAHHHHHHHHHHH.MORE NORE MORE MORE.Seriously, the attention to detail is absolutely amazing, it's visually stunning and the music is so fun. I love the EDITING. GOOD JOB EDITOR. GOOD JOB EVERONE. MORE!!!SEASON TWO
SEASON TWO
SEASON TWO
SEASON TWO
!!!!!!!!",10
Time wasting series,"I couldn't finish the first two episodes and quit. They created a world, but the world has literally our modern culture with some sci-fi/fantastic creatures. The characters are stupid, and the writing is so off. In the first episode, they don't want to touch or be around outsiders, and in the second episode, the main girl walks around and wants to shake strangers' hands. All characters are literally stupid, but they look like they tried creating funny/goody characters, but it's an epic fail. Time wasting. I wish I could get my time back. Whoever voted this series high is the reason for my wasted time.",2
Just WOW,"This....... This is how a game to TV adaptation is done. Absolutely phenomenal series. Loved it from start to finish.The attention to detail was spot on. From the tvs to the stimpaks. Including the game music too just made it even better. I binged watched it over two nights and will undoubtedly will watch it a few more times.Characters were sensational. The ghoul character was simply brilliant.Amazon and Bethesda have hit a home run with this. I hope and pray that there will be a second series and more.It has also reignited my love for the fallout games and I'm revisiting fallout 3, new Vegas, 4 and 76 again.",10
Incrediblely fun and faithful adaptation.,"Excellent show all around for fans of the game and non fans alike. It's a incrediblely faithful adaptation but still feels fresh and there's an incredible attention to detail that'll give fans a lot to look out for. It almost feels like you're in the game at certain times as they've really captured the look and feel of Fallout, I think it'll definitely get a bunch of people jumping back into game as I am doing so myself. The acting is good enough all around and Walton Goggins is excellent as usual, the effects look great and the sound design as well as the soundtrack are phenomenal too. The plot is interesting and although it's fresh story it'll seem very familiar to fans of the game. It's dark,fun and full of gore, contains sex scenes and nudity but doesn't even seem excessive, cheap or exploitative. Honestly just all around great experiences and definitely worth binging in one go.",10
I want to be a surface dweller and then some,"I'm a binge fiend. If I buy a whole block of chocolate it won't survive the car ride home from the shop. I can't help myself. So I buy two. In the case of a great tv series such as Fallout there is no seconds.This series should have been released weekly to allow us to lust and pine over it with fellow fans between indulgences. I barely played the game so don't know the story from which the Fallout tv series is derived. I dare say I didn't need to because this story quality for me stands alone so Amazon should treat shows this good with the respect and currency they hold.I ask that if Amazon decision makers read this post they take it as advice for season two to think about how a similarly pitched customer market for a story from competitor Apple released a very good but not as great a series as Fallout is called Silo that went as a weekly release. Apple would have done this with Fallout and we would all eat it up. Give something to appreciate a streaming service we pay good money for- quality over garbage quantity.Whilst you're at it Amazon, give Fallout a bigger budget to let us explore the details of the vast surface dwelling environment (and vaults if course) through the lenses of the characters. With more freaky characters and monsters too please, but at least give us something to look forward to each week rather than the sugar dump.",9
"Thank you, Thank You, Thank you Bethesda and Amazon","Yes, I'm a fanboy and a huge Fallout fan, this show pays homage to all of the games. There is something for everyone who loves the story. But this is just a great show.At a time when Disney is getting away with 30 minute shows and destroying their fan base; thank you for making an actual hour long show, with a good NEW story based in a world that is well established. Masterfully woven so that at the end you get it tied up with an open door to continue on.Im a huge Walter Goggins fan. So many call backs to great westerns in this show and he play the best ""bad"" misunderstood good guy. Best actors. They did a marvelous job with what they were given. I can't wait till the next season.",10
"Yep, this is very good!!","As a huge fan of the video games, I was hoping this would be great and it was. It must be challenging to 1) Satisfy all the fanboys like me and 2) Satisfy people who have never played Fallout. The creators obviously studied the lore, loads of little easter eggs in there, and my wife loved it who has never played Fallout , in fact hates the game as she has observed me spending hours roaming the wastelands commiting atrocities 🤣. What I found most impressive is they got the whole Fallout vibe correct. It should actually be a dark horror game, an apocalyptic wasteland with giant cockroaches, mutants, horrible deaths... yet the game always injected so much dark humour it made light of the situation and made it fun. The show does this as well. With so many disappointing adaptations of classic games or books in the last few years, resident evil, rings of power, Halo to name a few where the creators just threw away the lore and did there own thing Fallout gets it right. There's enough in thier for fans and enough in there for newbies. The acting and script are no masterpiece but why should it be? It's good enough, if you want A grade acting and scripts theres Oppenheimer etc. Fallout is supposed to be a dark comedy set in a messed up world and it does just that.",9
This series resets the 1-10 scale,"I just finished the season 1 finale of ""Fallout"".I feel like I need to go back through all of my IMDb ratings where I awarded a ""10"" and lower them to ""9"". This series is a game changer.This was not just one of the best video game adaptations I've ever seen.This was not just one of the best debut seasons of a television series that I've ever seen.This was, quite frankly, astonishing.Come for the coal mine-dark humor. Stay for the engaging performances. Walk away, mesmerized by the in-depth world building, the heartbreaking twists and turns, and the agony of knowing that you will have to wait at least a year to see what happens next.Amazon Prime has finally, at long last, found its ""Game of Thrones""... but ""Fallout"" has the potential to eclipse that series. Okie dokie!",10
Pass the Ammunition...,"Amazon and the entire crew here nailed it. I'm a huge Fallout fan of the game for decades and was not expecting this! Wow. Incredible. I wanted to watch all 8 episodes at once. Bravo. Genius. Let's ink another 10 seasons.Lucy is wonderful. She is the perfect naive Vault dweller. Maximus is not what you'd expect from a Brotherhood of Steel member, but he is excellent. The Ghoul, top notch. Mr Goggins was born for this role. He is John Wayne and Clint Eastwood with a little Mel Gibson; Mad Max all perfectly joined.I will watch this several more times to catch all the hidden gems like the mention of Maximus in the copter saying something about Tempering Alloy on the Power Armor. A mod in the game that I missed the first time.Gamers will love this. Non gamers, just watch it. You will really be glad you did.",10
Takes me back to the best gaming days I had with fallout 4 as a teenager,"I love the Fallout series. I started playing Fallout 4 when it launched, and I was just a teenager then. I have the fondest memories of any game I've ever played with Fallout 4, having spent hundreds of hours in the game, which provided some of the most cherished memories I look back upon. I was so immersed in that universe that for years, I searched online for more content or something similar that could help me relive that time again. This show really does that! It took me back to being the same teenager who could not tear his eyes away from the screen, playing the game for hours on end, and now I've watched the entire show in one stretch. Thank you to everyone who made this possible. I've been following this show since Amazon Prime dropped the teaser years ago, and I'm so glad it's everything I expected. I love Fallout, and even though I'm older now, this is the series that has immersed me the most in almost a decade.",10
"Divine, captivating, imaginative.","My lord, I'm a gamer, my wife not, both of us found this show captivating, 3 days it took to complete, that's including me off for 24 hours for a major business meeting .. ... we are already clucking for the next instalment .. well written, fantastic actors all of them, story is addictive, effects amazing... we conclude star wars, mandalorian, mad max and walking dead mixed to create, what we hope is ever lasting ... longer than walking dead, episodes and something we can follow until we die... my lord ... keep them coming, do not give up, pass the baton to your kids .... just keep them coming... please x.",10
Best Game Adaptation I've Ever Seen,"Gamers and movie adaptations of games have always had a rocky relationship. We appreciate Angelina for Tomb Raider. Uncharted was fun, mindless action with subpar casting. Assassin's Creed was...well, we try not to remember. It seemed as though the video game curse were doomed to repeat itself, until we were blessed with Craig Mazin's The Last of Us. Beautiful stories, jaw dropping sets, and amazing performances from the lead actors.I thought to myself, ""It'll probably be another 10-15 years before we get a decent adaptation like that."" I couldn't be happier to be wrong. Fallout doesn't demand your attention, its struts its stuff and you can't help but watch. The cast is amazing, the story is gripping, the violence is bloody fantastic (literally) and the choice to make the soundtrack a blend of music from different Fallout games is just a perfect little maraschino cherry on top.I don't really understand the two reviews that are hating on it. To each their own, but this series is amazing and deserves a fair chance. Absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see more. Amazon is killing it this year.",10
Absolutely mind-bendingly magnificent!!!,"The series is created off of the game. It sticks to the games originality and quirkiness, whilst having it's own originality. Twists and turns throughout the storyline. The actors are fantastic. Honestly.. the comedy, innocence, gore, ruthless, quirky, plot twists to this series that's off beat but absolutely stunning when the last episode ended it have wasted one of my 3 gene wishes for another 4 series in a row...If Amazon are sending out fund raisers for a second series I've got £20 in my pocket.. knock on my door and it's yours!The Nolan brothers can't do any wrong at the moment can they?",10
"Was bracing for the worst, ended up being the best!","So been playing the fallout games for roughly a decade or so. Been through Fallout 3, New Vegas, 4 and even 76. Love the games so much I have a Vault Boy tattooed on my arm.Honestly, I went into this show with the lowest of expectations. The history of games becoming shows has been shaky at best (besides Last of us, of course). I braced for disappointment. Gotta say, Fraking love this damn show. I always have bloody mess running and the splatter factor was very on point.The peace in the show lasts a whole 10 minutes, like the games, before things go horribly wrong, so very on brand. Love seeing all the realistic versions of vertibirds, yao guai's, power armor, gulpers. Brahmin could be a little more radiated looking but I can forgive it.Goggins is perfect and can do no wrong. He kills it in his role. All the other characters are awesome too, but I'm only 3 episodes in. Stoked to see where the series goes, loving the subtle and not-so-subtle references to the game. There were points where I couldn't help but say ""fraking side quests"" and laugh at how the story was going.It's a great time to watch, yeah I could sit and nitpick every little thing but why? I like the story, it reminds me of Fallout, it respects the game and gamers who play it, funny in the right ways and appropriately inappropriate in the level of gore which I was hoping they would do!",10
Fan of Fallout games not of the show,"If you like it great keep watching it I honestly don't care I'm just gonna list off reasons why I don't like loving a series that seems to be retconning/resetting all the past things they've created for something new that seems lame or same old cliche.Apparently the NCR isn't around anywhere in Cali; I'm 4 episodes in and I haven't seen a trace of them in any society function. Its only been 15-20 years since NV. They would be like Roman Empire, broken but into pieces more than anything. Nope its just people in tin shacks.Turning the BoS into this edgy london Knight/Lord theme. Yes their titles are Knight/Elder/Scribe/etc however I've never once seen them have dialogue like this show does. Its hammered into them since either birth in the bunkers or if we're going east coast then since they join.I'm not crazy of Lucy being the center not cause shes a bad actor but because I would of enjoyed her more if they simply either gave her smaller lines or mute to transition a RPG character almost just being dragged along in the story like most do.The writing is basic, people act like this is masterpiece writing but it isn't. They've done the father/son/daughter thing now 3 times.Fallout 3/4 and now this show. Its getting old. Oh but guess what the vault's waterchip is busted where else have I seen this.The world is bland, feels like they spent most of the budget on actors/costumes and thats about it. Theres one ""settlement"" if you wanna call it that and its somehow worse than megaton. Again in Cali where NCR had a full fledged nation happening.",5
Abysmal,"Where do I even begin with this disaster of a TV series? 'Fallout' is an absolute travesty that manages to squander every ounce of potential it had. From the poorly written dialogue to the laughable special effects, it's clear that the creators had no clue what made the original video game franchise so beloved.Let's start with the acting, or lack thereof. The performances are so wooden and uninspired that you'd think the cast was made up of department store mannequins. Not even the most talented actors could salvage the atrocious script they were given. Every line feels forced and devoid of any emotion, leaving viewers cringing in their seats.And don't even get me started on the production quality. The sets look like they were thrown together in someone's backyard, complete with cheap props and shoddy costumes. The CGI is so bad that it's almost comical, with mutant creatures resembling poorly rendered blobs rather than terrifying monstrosities.But perhaps the most unforgivable sin of 'Fallout' is how it completely misses the mark on capturing the essence of the video games. Gone is the sense of exploration and discovery, replaced instead with mind-numbingly dull plotlines and tedious exposition. It's as if the creators took everything that made the games great and tossed it out the window in favor of generic post-apocalyptic clichés.In conclusion, 'Fallout' is a train wreck of a TV series that should be avoided at all costs. Save yourself the agony and stick to playing the video games instead. At least then you'll have some semblance of enjoyment amidst the nuclear fallout of this abysmal adaptation.",1
One of TV's biggest disappointments.,"Damn this tv show frustrated me. So so much potential. I really truly thought they were going to deeply explore the fascinating politics, the vault experiments, corruption, monopoly economics etc. Then came the final episode which appeared to have been written solely to wrap everything up and create a new arena of Brotherhood vs New California for Season 2. It was written so poorly that half of the wrap up points didn't make any sense. So Vault Tec destroyed the entire Earth's economy just to gain monopoly power over said economy, despite already being the world dominating monopoly? How is that profitable? By bombing the entire Earth, you've destroyed literally all the physical and human resources which drive production of all Earth's goods and services. Nobody is paying Vault Tec membership fees anymore once their home is bombed and they're forced underground into the vaults, costing Vault Tec money. How disappointing that something that had such potential was ended so poorly. Will not return for season 2.",3
"Review of ""Fallout"": Excessively Violent and Unnecessarily Gory","While ""Fallout"" had the potential to be an engaging series with its rich post-apocalyptic setting and intriguing plot, it is significantly marred by its over-reliance on graphic violence. The show's frequent and graphic depictions of violence often feel gratuitous, overshadowing the storyline and character development.The gore in ""Fallout"" is not just present; it is pervasive and at times extreme, making it difficult to watch for those who are sensitive to such content. This overemphasis on brutality can alienate viewers who might appreciate the narrative or the world-building aspects of the series. It's disappointing that the creators decided to lean so heavily into these elements, as the show could have been captivating without such intense and graphic scenes.",5
"If you've never played the games, they're not this lighthearted!","As a long time Fallout fan, I was really looking forward to this show. Having seen all of it now, I'm not really disappointed, but let down. If you've never played any of the games, I think this show will be of great interest to anyone who likes science fiction. But for those of us who are dedicated fans (hundreds of hours in 3 and New Vegas, and thousands of hours in 4,) this show will miss the mark. But really only slightly. Everything you'd expect to be in this show is here, but the tone is off. Everyone is very happy-go-lucky for too long into the season. And serious moments are always cut with some sort of humor. I would encourage everyone to watch and judge for themselves, but go in with tempered expectations.",5
Slow and Boring,"I've played some video games in my life, Fallout not being one of them. I understand how fans of the game are happy to see it as a series. They keep saying how much it looks like the game and how it's artistically accurate. But is that it? Shouldn't things happen clearly when you turn a game into a series or movie. A reviewer said it's more fun to watch someone play the game than watch this. I completely agree. I watched the first episode and didn't feel like watching the second. I started the second episode and waited, bored until 2 thirds into it before something happened. We don't get time to know the main characters and they just wander around saying lame dialogs. One cannot even compare this to the Last of Us series which has humor, action and characters you care about and really good script. Fallout tried to include cameos by familiar faces to make up for how lame this show is but even Walton Goggin or Michael Rapaport can't save this. Watch Walton Goggin in Justified where he's given a good script and be amazed. As for this Fallout... i mean Strikeout I'm done with it. Can't wait for the second season of The last of us.",2
The power armour was good. The writing was not.,"Those who worked on the props, the sets, the costumes and those who tried their best to act hard for this deserve applause.The writers however should have been locked in a room with a few copies of Fallout 1-4 and not allowed near a word processor till they understood the setting properly. Or learned how to write satisfying narrative and well made characters.Video game adaptations can be great. Castlevania for example was a case of beautifully constructed writing, characterisation and faithfulness to a fanbase and setting that was rewarded with adoration by the fans, myself included. This was not that.I watched the entire thing. This felt like a show written by people who had a vague idea and exposure to what Fallout is, but who were ultimately awful at writing characters you want to see more of. Goggins Ghoul does his best to save the show.They scattered endless member berries throughout the show to evoke reactions of 'dontcha remember this from the game?!'... 'Oh look, he said 'war never changes'!... dontcha remember that? That power armour was cool wasn't it?!'. It's gratuitous and overbears the entire show, because it's the only way to hide the sheer foul stench from the writing.The power armour was cool.It looks like Fallout. It sounds like fallout. It smells like something Dogmeat left for you.",3
Are expectations now so low this drivel is considered good?,"First I am a gamer. Huge Eldarscrolls fan for years. Huge rpg fan. Love sci-fi.However I will be upfront and say I played a bit of FO3 and thought it was a bit crap to be honest. Horrid interface, lacked good mod support like Oblivion and the endless knives and forks and microwave parts. Oh and it's a personal opinion but I hate the 50s retro sci fi thing.Why do I say this. To be upfront. This has such good reviews I thought I'd put my biases behind me and give it a shotWell where do I startA guy survives an impossible gunfire situation
Why was the gun there?Why did it seem to do very little to the building?Why did it even shoot at him?And I guess more importantly how the f did he and his dog survive?Tone. All over the place and horribly inconsistent
Maybe it's trying to be funny. I have even heard the worries dark and satirical. Well let's just say Gervais doesn't have to worry about any competition any time soon. It's isn't funnyEffects. Vary a lot. General scenery is often good. The pink lake monster utter shteWhy was there stereotypical ash shape humans you know the ones after a nuclear fire right outside the vault that have apparently been untouched and suffering no erosion after 200 years!!!!Why does the idiot and annoying squired gadget just happen to be able to instantly track the ghoul right when it was convenient!Why is Maximus such an idiot? Why leave his armour un hidden for anyone to nick? Why leave the giant gun behind? Why leave his supplies behind? Why reveal himself to his squire after treating him like absolute crap? His character needs to die quicklyThe power armour. Not bad but that entrance into the settlement as in the trailer omg bad and cheesy doesn't even touch itHow does a ninja kick suddenly allow you to knock a robot saw away. Looked pretty sturdy to me
. Oh yeah and with a severe foot injury that seemed to just conveniently disappearOh and I know it's the whole retro theme thing but seriously that doesn't mean the vault overseas and the people living there have to be completed stupid.If they screw up 40k this bad I'm gunna be real upset.",2
"Shallow, uninspired, cheesy and cliche","Played fallout 3 and new Vegas and enjoyed them alot years ago but wouldn't call myself a diehard or purist fan so thought I'd essentially be the perfect target audience for this show.Apparently I was very very wrong.This show feels like it's trying to mimic about 5 different movies to create the effect of good TV but it misses the mark so so hard and comes across as uninspired, cheesy and so so cliche. There is not a hint of actual style or artistry in this. Every scene involves some shallow character overtly state some defining characteristic of themself (over some emotional music and maybe slow motion) before something bad happens to them which you inevitably don't care about because the character in question has no depth and the thing that happens is so hyperbolic, overly dramatic and honestly stupid that you are sat there cringing in your seat.Watched episode 1 and definitely don't feel the need to watch anymore. Jesus Christ Amazon sort yourself out.",4
Magnificent picture of a fall,"Very decent cast, some awesome settings, others quite poor, with cardboard characters and a penchant for senseless grotesquery that serves no narrative purpose.They completely forgot that a videogame player is an active agent, and one not very demanding story-wise, that a videogame rushed narrative will eventually not translate very well into an engaging script.And thus, yet another plastic concoction of our times. The devastation we see on-screen reflects directly the barren wasteland of script writing for a majority of large budget productions.The loud noise and blood splatter equates with the clueless show runners tossing failed ideas in the recycle bin.And time. Time utterly lost by way of mediocre storytelling.It does seek some kind of redemption in the very last episode. Too little, too late.Digest and forget, or avoid at all.",5
You may not like it if you aren't a game fan,"As a woman and a non game fan I wouldn't recommend this show. It is made well but has nothing in it I want to see. It is essentially the game turned into a tv show... but that doesn't mean I will want to see any of it. Some examples from the first two shows... the main character, alleged to be a spoiled girl, essentially has sex with a raider (criminal) under false pretenses, has her father kidnapped, and her response... go out into the very scary world to get him back. Um... that is what a character in a game does... no girl has those reactions. Soon we are introduced to a character that has his foot taken clear off and dies from the bleeding and what does this girl do? Removes his head as he asked. Right, as you do? There is no humanity in this show, just game characters and thus no one to root for.",2
Massacre of classic Fallout and New Vegas,"As soon I saw that they destroyed NCR in 2277 when Battle of Hoover Dam took place in New Vegas, I realized that Bethesda doesn't like spotlight which Obsidian got and Has with classic Fallout and New Vegas. Also, Vault Tec being responsible for war and nuking is just lazy writing and not showing respect towards franchise.This show is made for people who never played nothing beyond Fallout 3 and 4 and for general audience which wants ""cool"" post apocalyptic show.Fallout was always about post-post-apocalypse and not about post-apoclypse.Bethesda, sell your IP to someone who has more heart in doing it.",1
Lost me after the first episode,"How can you introduce so many things into the world while still not really explaining a single one of them. This first episode which should have set the tone for the rest of the series just threw many concepts of the Fallout universe at the viewer's face without even taking two seconds to elaborate.What are these bunkers? Who build them? How did the people get there? What are the Brothers of Steel and why should we care? Why are there these metal giants? What is the enclave? Who are those raiders? What happened to bunker 32? ...I get it that these questions may be answered later, but I don't feel like continuing when not even a single thing has been properly established in over one hour.",1
I COULD NOT FINISH THE FIRTS EPISODE IT WAS SO BAD,"Against my natural antipathy towards post apocalyptic stuff, I was intrigued by a 5 star rating this series was given by Lucy Mangan in the Guardian.The plot was paper thin. It was so obvious what was going to happen and the level of insult to anyone with a brain was appalling!For example the Lucy Maclean stabbing survival was unbelievable. A stab in the gut is always serious and one should not remove the knife if it is still in the wound. This was followed by the even worse idea that her 'husband' came back to attack her.Equally stupid was the fact that her wrist mounted radiation as well as everyone else's did not go off the moment they met the people from Vault 32. It was clear radiation level awareness was high, but to fail to have automated alarms was, frankly, alarmingly moronic.I skipped forward a few scenes to the army camp and the arrival of the men in suits and immediately thought 'where was the airship built and where were the suits made?'. I had already been wondering about the construction of the vaults themselves, but the industrial level the airship & suits implied was far too farfetched.I could go on but I hope the foregoing gives you enough of the flavour of silliness which clearly is only going to get worse.My advice is avoid like the plague.",1
"Robots v robots, gore desensitisation","Like every other modern movie/show, you can't care about the main characters, and therefore can't care what happens in the rest of the show.All lines are written robotically. Some actors appear to bring a little humanity to them, but ultimately this is 99% of the show. Contrived robotic lines.Actors stare or speak perfectly smooth, always waiting for their turn.All ""kicks"" or drama is based around betrayal, as if this is high drama for robots... no human drama is seen anywhere... such as itchy clothes, things getting in the way, team work, personal style (hair, talking, walking, motivations).On top of the robotic script, actors, and drama, the show is also pushing gore desensitisation, and acting tough, and this is supposed to be sold to teenagers interested in video games...",1
Disjointed and bland with a terrible soundtrack!,"I have never played the games, but I heard a lot of raving about how great this series was so figured it was worth a shot.There were some okay scenes, but throughout the opening episode we are bashed over the head with far too much awful music that distracts from what could have been more entertaining.It never really gripped my attention, despite a few nice ideas. But the main issue I had was the lack of clarity behind what was going on. Of course, there was nuclear fallout, but why were some living in bunkers and others in the outside world? Why was one from the bunker so confident to venture outside when it had already been stated that it wouldn't be safe for at least another generation. I reached the point where I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to carry on watching any further episodes.Maybe fans of the games can see more than I did, but I can't be bothered carrying on with this series.",4
Pretty good but it has a cringey feel to it!,"I recently caught the Fallout TV series and it's definitely an interesting watch. There were moments that felt a tad cringey, especially with some of the acting, but I have to admit, the gore was on point. It's a bit of a mixed bag - some scenes really nail it, while others fall a bit short. Still, I'd say it's worth giving it a shot. Personally, I found myself enjoying it despite the occasional awkward performance. You can tell they really invested heavily in production - the sets, props, and effects are top-notch. Surprisingly, it exceeded my expectations. That said, there's room for improvement, particularly in the acting department. It feels like they may have prioritized visuals over casting, but hey, it worked out pretty well in the end. Overall, a solid effort, but there's definitely potential for even greater things with some tweaks here and there.",5
A spit in the face to long time fans,"I was looking forward to this show since it came out and all was well, I was enjoying it, but when I watched episode 6... Todd Howard has used his connections to basically do the adult version of destroying a lego set because he didn't get to be the one to build it. If you're a fan of 1, 2, or New Vegas do not watch this show because they will piss on you and not even have the grace to call it rain. They destroyed the NCR, in fact, making it so the NCR was destroyed PRE New Vegas, therefore nullifying it. This is such an adult temper tantrum. This was made out of anger and spite that Obsidian made a better game and it shows.Good actors though. Sorry that good acting can't save bad writing.",3
Poor acting by main characters except the ghoul,"Very poor acting and direction. May be poor casting choice - Whenever Ms Maclean and Maximus are shown - they simply destroyed their characters. It certainly killed the vibe of the game. Ms maclean character seemed portrayed as a teen whereas she is an adult who has zero to none understanding about outside world/zero self defence and she lived due to mercy of others. Though she is attacked, she behaves like a teen - no seriousness at all. Whereas maximus - his character is simply powerless. Play the game folks. Only entertainment is ghoul - superb acting and casting choice. Also this confuses - who are the actual target audience.",4
Silly and tedious.,"I have never played the game, and so come to it with no expectations, but reviewing this as a stand-alone show I am quite unimpressed. The story is a pretty run of the mill post nuclear apocalypse yarn about feral humans trapped on the surface and privileged people dwelling in underground bunkers until things go wrong and they are forced to interact.The storyline is silly, some of the scenes comedic for no discernible reason, the pacing is dreadfully slow and the characters unengaging. Two episodes in I simply find myself uninterested in continuing to be bored by this.Perhaps, were I an aficionado of the game, I would enjoy it more and be looking forward to future storylines but I'm not, so I can't, and the production does not have enough going for it to make me continue with it.",2
"Just because it looks like Fallout, doesn't make it a good adaptation","Old Fallout fans finally get a return to the West Coast, and I wish we hadn't asked for it.If you are a fan of the original Fallout games, you'll remember the town of Shady Sands. That got nuked. Which perfectly sums up how Bethesda feels about anything that came before 3.The writers call themselves fans, but there are multiple examples of them ignoring established lore. Ghoulifcation does not work the way it is represented in the show. They changed how power armors propulsion works, which having them jet up from the arms exclusively makes literally 0 sense, even ignoring the fact that in itself ignores previously established lore.The story revolves around a Vault dweller going after a family member that left the vault. I find it ironic that the main story beat is one of the things they decided to actually keep consistent with the games seeing as everyone is exhausted with that.Also, the macguffin for this one is a magical device that will bring power and clean water to the wasteland. Sound familiar?They set up going to New Vegas in season 2 which is just horrible. Going there canonizes one of the endings depending on which factions are present, but we all know Todd hates New Vegas so i can't say I'm surprised.I will say it's deserving of the 1 star because at least the costume design was great. However I can honestly say, you'd have gotten a better representation of Fallout by playing 76 at launch.",1
"Really 8.7, Adolescent gamers delight","I've forced myself to watch two of the episodes before writing a review. Seriously, 8.7 , Gone with the Wind is 8.2! And like its famous ""I don't give a da*&"" line, episode 2, will create the long lasting ""He was screwing my chickens"", which I'm sure will go down in movie history. Why no mention of Demolition Man in the other reviews. The female character is S. Bullock, ditzy, naive but has the chutzpah underneath. And the exosuits have been used 10 times b4. No nose guy just made me think white Michael Jackson. All these gamers have put this in a rating it doesn't belong. Good special effects.",2
Watching someone else play a video game isn't particularly entertaining,"I tried. Really I tried. I watched the first two episodes. I fell asleep in the middle of each one. That does not bode well for the compelling nature of the show.I can see that they've spent a huge amount of money on very complicated sets. It's certainly a lavish production.But I never played the game. I mean I could see where certain elements were obviously storyboarded right off of a video game. And the NPC nature of a number of characters is clear enough. But am I supposed to care about an NPC? I don't know if I really care about these characters. This girl this naive girl who has incestuous relations with her cousin, is this who I'm supposed to root for? And then this Cowboy ghost/zombie whatever, am I supposed to care about him? I don't identify with any of these characters. I don't care about any of these characters.Look it starts they've been in a bomb shelter a long time. Okay. Radiation bad. Okay. And they decide they're going to trade marriages with the adjacent Enclave. Okay. Everybody seems to have Geiger counters on their wrists yet when the door opens up to the adjacent Enclave no one checks. I mean in a world filled with radiation you would think that would be the number one thing you do when you open the door. This doesn't seem very smart. This doesn't make anyone in this Enclave seem intelligent. It makes them seem like idiots. And they die like idiots.Do they think I'm going to identify with idiots and root for them? If so they are sorely mistaken.And then this naive girl decides she's going to go out all alone in the big bad and I don't know find Lassie or her father or whatever.I really don't care.When I watched Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire's character was similarly naive. But he was also smart. He made some intelligent moves. He made some blunders and he learned from them but the character seemed to grow.In this show I have a real sense of here's character a. Here is character b. Character B will say something to character a. Character B will now leave. Character a will now go to character C and say something. And on and on it goes. Girl loses her eye. Is this necessary to the plot? Would the story be any different if she never lost the eye? Guy loses his foot. Is this necessary to the plot? With the story be any different if he never lost his foot? So why am I seeing this.Continuing the Spider-Man comparison, when Peter Parker made a bad selfish call, he paid with the life of his uncle ben. This made a difference to the character to the story. From there on in you see him consciously making efforts to make better choices.I didn't get a sense of that with this show.Here's a guy. He's going to steal a Iron Man suit from another guy. He can't fly it very well. The flying looks very much like a man on wires. At one point the CGI slipped and I actually saw the wires a little bit. That wasn't good. With all the money they spent on sets here I'm surprised they went cheap on the flying effects. Robert Downey did it very well in iron man. If you're not going to meet that standard then don't show him flying.There's a difference between playing a video game and watching a movie. Maybe you haven't noticed but your friends aren't terribly entertained by watching you play a video game. Making a movie which is essentially the same as watching someone play a video game is not a good path.Anyhow. Two episodes was enough for me. I won't be back.It's not a bad production. If anything it's quite lavish in terms of sets. But if you want characters emotions things to identify with, the normal elements of the successful show, you won't find that here.",3
"Passable, but not even half as good as I expected","I've been a long-time Fallout fan, played the crap out of FO1 and 2 back in highschool, enjoyed Fallout Tactics. Got hyped up by Fallout 3 when Bethesda took over, played hundreds of hours in Fallout 4 and slowly lost my enthusiasm after 76 fiasco.Kinda sad, that such a huge franchise with such a rich lore ended up being downsized to incoherent flood of in-game references connected by yet another abysmal script. I have a feeling that writers haven't played anything other than fallout shelter before writing screenplay.Lots of things barely make any sense in the setting, especially when it comes to vaults and their inhabitants.It's passable as a rainy/snowy day time killer, but not something that I personally would consider a good film adaptation. Heck, some indie shorts on youtube did a better job at capturing a ""spirit"" of Fallout, while this show only focused on visually appearing ""fallout-y"".",5
Was clearly written for children...,"Episode one was mildly interesting. Episode 2 was a cliché-ridden bore. It was as if the writers had a very short list of things that were going to take place during episode 2 and had to drag out the action sequences as much as possible to take up time. Lots of pointless gore and really dumb in-fight choices on the part of the protagonists. I'm familiar with the game - never played it myself but have watched others play it. Maybe if you like the game you'll like the series because you'll see references to it throughout the episodes. But, if you're not a fan of the game, and you actually read books with good stories, you'll probably hate this series, so I recommend you don't waste your time. Like most garbage being produced these days, this series telegraphs everything that's going to happen, because the writers seems to not have any original ideas of their own.",1
"Fallout, ironically named","""Fallout"" (S01, 8eps, 45-min, Amzn Prime) is a video game adaptation apparently, never played it, so my review isn't dependent on that. I wanted to like this, I came to it with eager eyes. And yet, once again, Amazon Studios continues their onslaught of cultural re-engineering instead of producing quality, independent entertainment. This is another mighty-woman first series that will appeal to 5% of a cry-baby population and turn-off the 95% that should be enjoying it. The first episode was just so ridiculously stupid in too many ways to count including the stupid '50s musical soundtrack that was so displaced I thought I was imagining it. So I thought, alright, that's a throwaway episode, maybe the second will be better. No. Now add to all that crud, racial retribution, and even more incongruent 50s musicalia. I am SOOOOO tired of ""progressive"" studios absolutely ruining entertainment! I don't even want a new tv anymore! I'm watching less and less because of all this @#@#@# they're throwing at us!",2
"Todd Howard, why do you hate us so much?","While the show has good moments and charactersthat shows a surface level understanding for the lore of the show, it is inexcusable to simply retcon the works of games you never worked on. Bethesda has deemed the arguably best three games in the entire Fallout Series (1, 2, and New Vegas) null and void for a show that nobody will remember in years time whenut inevitably does not get renewed for a second season. Who signed off on this garbage fire that accomplishes nothing more than spitting in the eyes of the loyal fans who have maintained the games Bethesda has abandoned through countless mods and fixes they never bothered to get around to.",1
Poor writing and acting make this a dissapointing show,"After watching another lackluster adaptation in ""The Last of US"", I was hoping this one would be better. However, it was not. The acting, especially Maximus, his squire, and to a lesser extent, Lucy, drag the show down. The guy who plays Maximus is especially terrible. The writing is especially awful. Very little of the dialogue is unique or interesting. None of it is funny or thought-provoking to me. You would think that a highly anticipated TV show with Amazon and a Nolan behind it could have been done better. I guess this is just the world we live in. A race by streaming companies to provide as much content as possible without placing emphasis on some of the basic elements to a good TV show: writing and acting. Other than the set design, which was pretty great, this show is bad.",1
This show is a tragedy,"They destroyed the lore and decanonised fallout new vegas. Its good tv show if you forget its a fallout. Because as fallout it makes no sesne. How could Shady sands fall in 2277, just how? The NCR was fighting with Legion right after they lost the capital? And even so why is it never mentioned in the games? And dont get me started on the legion, from what people were talking it sounds like legion never existed. I dont know if the creator played the dust mod or what but now it makes sens that he doesnt care about fans opinion. He knew what the reaction of fans would be. The only explanation would be that todd wanted the show to look like it so he could finally kick new vegas out of canon. The show also have bad color palet for the fallout universe. Its a good show if you ignore the fallout part of it.",1
let the Fallout begin...,"Q: What is more boring, watching someone play a video game or watching a series based on a video game? A: Doesn't matter, either is boring whether you've played the game or not. Doubly so if you are an actual adult. In this case the game is Fallout 3.I've played the Fallout 3 video game and I thought it was one of the best single player video games I'd ever played. So, despite it being 16 years later, I was intrigued by the concept of a TV series based upon it. But the intrigue very quickly faded. Let's face it, the plot and writing of most games works because they are games and the interaction makes up for the weaknesses in story, plot, characters, etc. A video series doesn't have the interactivity to rely upon to liven up the show and make it interesting so its usually a failure. Such is the case with Fallout, the series.What you have here is a video game walkthrough of a 16 year old game. And just like the video game it is based upon it contains adult themes and graphic violence but is written for an audience who are actually too young to watch mature rated content.I'm envisioning a couple of guys from Bethesda kicking back with a stogie and a smile thinking about how they've cashed in on the same thing so many times now they've lost count of how many billions they've made off it. People sure do love copies of copies don't they? Yup, sure do.",3
As expected,"As expected, this is nothing but the typical easily palatable generic theme park ride version of Fallout, akin to a bethesda game so in that sense, it is the perfect video game adaptation.Its boring, predictable and everything looks cheap, developers just need to copy the general iconography of the series and remix its narrative elements into a formulaic narrative for the masses.Art is divisive, this is not art but trash. It deserves a 3, but for the sake of scale tipping, it gets a one. Something like this is only possible in a world where visual iliteracy is at an all-time high and i dream of what would be possible if fallout and other projects, film or otherwise, were made with artistic freedom and intention.",1
Too much not enough,"Let me first say, I don't play video games. And I never even heard of this one. The trailer look interesting and when our 18 year old want to watch with us, well you take the offer. Secondly I like Last of Us. Thought it was interesting and after years of sloughing through the Walking Dead final seasons, was a better take on the zombie genre.Now to Fallout. The last of us, I felt I didn't need anything from the video game to understand the story. However Fallout, not so much. If you play the game you'll probably get it more than I did. Fallout is more fantastical than I like. The script seems weak, the characters are little odd acting, campy? Not sure. The story drags in huge parts. The score is off.Yes it's a pretty shot show. Nice camera work. Nice color saturation. However for this 53 year old, it just wasn't my thing.",5
Decent watch,"Never played the game and think that is a problem for the series, I don't have a bond with the series to be able to stick with it. I've made it through 4 episodes and whilst not being bad it's not hooked me in to finish it off.If I don't go back to finish it I wouldn't be too bothered about it either.Show started off well and had great hopes for it, it fizzled out into yet another dystopian show with the same factions fighting for survival, gave me snowpiercer vibes.It also feels like Disney got involved in the making of it, some gory scenes followed up by a lot of PG moments. Maybe makes sense if you've played the game but for me it hasn't convinced me enough to finish it off.",5
Why can't there be a 0/10 review rating.,"Please dear god do not make any more shows for the Fallout series. I was really excited about this show coming out but in all reality the first episode was just ok, a the 2nd one made me not want to watch anymore. If this show was created to make me not want to see or play fallout anymore then you've succeeded. The Fallout games are a 10/10 and the show was just a huge disappointment. It feels like the everyone involved have never picked up a controller to play the game. If the show had a complete rework, it could possibly be good but as it stands I don't know why people are rating this show so high.",1
Good show. Very bad Fallout show.,"Good show. Very bad Fallout show. The show doesn't adhere to Fallout lore and they don't understand how the world works. The characters have a very obvious amount of makeup. Why would people with a finite amount of resources use them for makeup to make themselves look pretty. The power armor very obviously had no weight to them which made the added sounds even more jarring. They put fat people in the vault where they have regimented food. The raiders blow up a bomb with remote tech. The outfits are aways clean. Its the same with the locations they go to. Everyone and everywhere is too clean. They seem have forgotten this is post apocalypse. The world and people in the show doesn't look or act like atomic fallout has happened, they really mention rads and they don't encounter any radiation in the irradiated wasteland.",3
It's actually quite mediocre,"I don't doubt that this is considered awesome, out of some sort of fanaticism or personal obligation, for fans of the games. But, taken in isolation, from a story, character development, acting, and screenplay perspective (etc.), this is actually not very good, or at least certainly not worth its extraordinarily high ""8.5"" IMDB rating (at the time of this writing), which I think might suggest that most of the reviews come from game fans at the moment. I played one of the games (Fallout 3 for PS3) a long time ago, but did not find it very entertaining. In my opinion, there is no good explanation for the current rating.",3
The male and female leads are too disgusting,"One is a bad person who relies on betrayal, theft, and gambling in life, and the other is a lucky girl whose brain is controlled by hormones. The excessively disgusting male and female protagonists make people indifferent to their future development, and thus the entire drama is not worth caring about. To put it bluntly, that dog is more charming than the male and female protagonists. Not to mention the disgusting plot and setting, abandoning the plot of Fallout New Vegas and declaring Fallout 4 as the victory of the Brotherhood, a militaristic organization. But it has to be said that B's fans are really loyal, halo is fiercely criticized, radiation is praised, humorous.",1
Whoever made rings of power must have made Fallout,"Sadly just terrible. Big fan of the game series, so my dissapointment is immeasurable since a rendition this bad means it won't be renewed. Amazon is just a plague for IPs and now another one is effected by the blight of bad acting (looking at your smug clueless face Aaron Moten), terrible extras (Filly was a disgrace, on par with the monstrous modern star wars series) and ridiculous choices made by Amazon. People giving this a good review are on serious copium, shilling for amazon or they have lost their mind. I am immeasurably dissapointed and am now going to shoot my dog as a sacrifice to the gods in hope that they will curse Amazon out of existence.",1
"The actors are very good. The show, not so much.","The show starts with potential, then falls off a cliff rapidly, which is subsequently sent down a long, long hill. Actors do a good job with their material, however, most come off very unlikable. The action is serviceable, however it has apparent, obvious nitpicks that you could dissect. Logic of both action and downtime feels very floaty and seems wildly inconsistent scene to scene. Dialogue is passable however seems intent on out of place comedy. Instead of a comedy, it would have serviced better as a thoughtful tale instead of trying to appeal to an out of touch funny wonderland. It's connection to the games seems to be an unfortunate attachment that forces it to an awkward compromise, though it should have been disconnected for both fans and non-fans alike so it could spread wings better. Even for non-fans, there's glaring issues with it's continuity and logic, complete with unremarkable inconsistent problems with the overall story.",1
No sense in this show,"Is was spoiled by his presence all the ""Fallout"" and all the nucleus theme of the show. More men suffer from complexes is difficult to imagine. How could this happen, that it became known as an actor?? Party crowd, more of talent should not apply. Many people think that Craig, obscene in their choice. So I say, 100 (hundred) Craig saints next to them in this regard. Just annoying to be extremely slow, clumsy turns of the body. And sits in a chair like a pregnant bear. It's awful indecent and ugly to see on the screens. I totally was not to be interested in watching of a TV series with this mistakes and while the breaks to see the advertising staff. The series ""Fallout...."" I started to watching from the Season 1 in the hope there to see actors and instead of these great actors had to seen the entire screen obscured by unsympathetic. TV Shows on the nucleus theme, and so not very much so, and spoil their presence by such as the dogmeat. Do not respect the viewers time. Kind regards only salutations.",1
Worst Parody TV Series ever,"First) Lucy McClean do very close to Lucy MacClane. This character is the worst parody of Brenden Fraser character in Blast to the Past. She's mentally lost but supposed to be the best fighter from Vault 23.Second) the ghoul gun fighter reminds of the Spaghetti western My Name is Nobody and acts worst than thst character.The subplot, if there's one, has nothing to with Fallout.The area has something to do with Fallout and thats all.The 8s,9s and 10s from reviewers and critics are heinous and no one actually played all the games.Fake creation of Fallout history.The dog is the only good actor.The writing for the whole story/episodes is childish and robotic.The musical score is the worst especially in Episode 1 fight scene.",1
Fallout: quirky redditor Marvel edition.,"Video game adaptations are everywhere nowadays, most of them are horrible. This one is one of the worst out there.You take a game series, make a TV show version of it, declare it to be a ""canon"" continuation of the games and let a bunch of Marvel loving redditors with Liberal arts degree write for it, what is the result?The result is a show that shows zero respect for the original games, contradicting them left and right, laughably bad writing where even the tiniest amount of thinking makes the whole show fall apart, and of course, a show stuffed full with current day propaganda, much like the vast majority of everything that comes out nowadays, with incompetent ehite males, goofy weak black males, Mary sue protagonist, pregnant woman mowing down raiders while laughing manically, WOW! So badass guys!, remember that scene whenever someone tells you this series is mature. Tiny FtM creature who's stronger than actual men and looks more uncanny than any of the ghouls... I could go on, this was all just in the FIRST episode by the way.The writing itself is beyond awful, the conflicts are reliant on every character being an idiot. Not to mention a lot of scenes are just stupid, they outrun a nuke by riding on a horse come on.The choreography and cinematography are amateurish, awkward camera angels, and any scene that has someone punching someone else doesn't even look like the guy's being hit by the punch and the CGI is really bad.The humor is straight out of reddit and Marvel, that wouldn't feel out of place in a modern Disney movie...I swear there's so much wrong with this that I could list them here all day long, but long story short, don't watch this. Just don't. Everyone who recommended this to you on YouTube or whatever has previously hated very similar shows to it, but this one gets praised because we don't have any standards anymore and anyone will sing praises of any awful piece of media if they're paid well enough.",1
Did Amazon just buy Disney?,"There are several, not so subtle little nuances that will make you think just that.Amazon has just bought Disney and then have them make them a TV-series made from the ideas of a computer game.Since other games were already taken - or discarded a being impossible to make a cinematic adaption of - the victim of this hypothetical monstrosity, was the epic war-strategy-game Fallout.Ok, now how do we come to the conclusion that Disney is involved? Well, quite simple. In less than 20 minutes, we had a so-called ""6-scene"" .. that immediately turned into a musical act (and a one that even Bollywood would be ashamed of) and lost all kind of sensuality.To this, ad a very tired and uninspired Kyle McLachlan, with a range of expresions only slightly above that of a piece of granit rock.It took me less than 22min of this show to realize .. you will never get those minutes back, so why waste them on this peak of ridiculousness?No, save yourself the pain and let your brain not have to suffer an aneurysm from trying to drown itself to end the torment.",1
Completely butchers the game franchise,"As a fallout player who has played Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas and Fallout 4, I was excited about this series.However, the first episode was one of the worst things I've had the displeasure of ever watching.There's a joke every two minutes and the tone is way too light. It doesn't take the fallout world seriously. I felt like I was watching a comedy show halfway through the episode.The actors and actresses are very annoying and the series overall just feels very unpolished.This should be enough for you not to waste your time on this series. I know I surely won't be watching any more episodes. Absolute garbage.",1
Average at best - another violence infested US show,"Violence over substance: The creators seem to believe that more bloodshed equates to better drama.Heads explode, bodies fly, and video game logic reigns triumphant!But violence alone cannot sustain a series. The relentless gore becomes numbing, overshadowing any semblance of character development or plot progression.Acting Fallout: The cast struggles to rise above the mediocrity of the script. Ella Purnell, as Lucy, delivers a strong performance, but her character's journey feels lost in the chaos.Walton Goggins, playing The Ghoul, is the standout, but even his smooth-talking chaos can't salvage the sinking ship...
The rest of the ensemble flounders, their potential squandered.Inconsistent Tone: ""Fallout"" wavers between dark humor and grim violence. While some appreciate the juxtaposition of punchlines amidst the apocalypse, others find it jarring. The show's tone resembles a bipolar wasteland, leaving viewers disoriented and disconnected.Plot Potholes: The narrative stumbles like a ghoul with a broken leg. Instead of weaving a compelling story within the established Fallout universe, the show opts for a new tale.Unfortunately, it lacks depth and coherence. The puzzle-box mystery occasionally intrigues but often over-complicates matters.Missed Opportunities: With nearly three decades of game lore, ""Fallout"" had a treasure trove to explore.Yet, it squanders this potential. The satire, wackiness, and rich world-building from the games are diluted, leaving fans yearning for more.",5
Dissapointed - Feels like Tarantino not post apocalyptic world.,"Where's Ron Pearlman ?I love Fallout World since the first game but this poor adaptation is more like fallout 76 squeezing the Lemon , than plant the seed of something great.Does not capture the ambience of desolation of wasteland , even the clothes seems brand new not trash that we used to, the locations don't feel real, looks like a plateau set of a studio. Not even mentioned the forced ethnic protagonist.The power armour feels synthetic not real. The CGI is not well designed.The actors done good , but the ambience lacks of POST APOCALYPTIC ADAPTATION (very bright lightning ).Too much bethesda and so little Little black isle style for me.War War never changes... money either.",1
Worse Adaption Ever,"As the title said. This is the worse adaption ever. It doesn't even stay true to the source material. At no point in this series did the main character clip into the ground and fall out of the map. There was also a severe lack of Macho Man Randy Savage and Thomas the Tank Engine deathclaws in this series. How can you be authentic to Fallout without delivering the classic Bethesda jank that makes Fallout great in the first place? Bethesda's philosophy is nowhere to be seen in this entire series. When one thinks Bethesda, one thinks of a half baked unfinished product, and that is fine. You know why? Because the fans will fix it anyway. It just works.",1
Amazon have ruined yet an other great institution,I'm on ep 6 and nothing has happened. The fallout games aren't boring so why is the TV series? It's so small in comparison but theyvr completely watered everything down to suit a wider audience than sticking with the lore. Like LOTR they've mismanaged something that could have been brilliant for them. I've seen so far 1 gulper and 4 radroaches. Which makes complete sense since literally everyone complained about FO76 and I don't remember gulpers before then. It seems like a nursery ride compared to the games. The people don't see any real threats. There's 1 small group of raiders. Too much back story and not enough stuff going on in real time. Complete waste of time and money. I do like the cast. Whish is about as good as my reviews gets. Also seeing the sets brought to live is nice but that's it.,4
Too much violence,"I was excited to see the shows. But I wasn't expect to see nude man, too much blood and gore, too much cuss words. Story lines and characters a little different than my vision of Fallout styles. I wish the shows more of pg-13, because I have wife and kid around. My wife didn't like hearing too much cuss words. My daughter who is age 5 and there's full nude of man having sexual with Lucy. I know a lot of people like that to keep good score and liking the shows for rating. But I wish the shows more of pg-13. The Ghoul is mean to Lucy on episode 3...wwhhhyyyy!?!? :( Lucy could have told Ghoul the truth that the gulper took the head.",5
Cute world,"This is not fallout world. This is the Care Bears world. Characters without charisma. A colorful world not apocalyptic. The story is boring. Steel brother armors are made of polystyrene. LoL. Nothing is realistic. Everything is bland. Tasteless. This a serie created with the name fallout and fallout character, but not in the philosophy of a real fallout world. Not think for the old fans who made fallout known in the world.only references to fallout 4. As if bethesda wants to send a message (fallout 1, 2, new vegas do not exist). The pip boy it is also in polystyrene. This a fake world not apocalyptic world.",1
Disgusting,"Serious? I'm not familiar with the Fallout games, so I started watching this series out of curiosity, the high ratings showed that it could be something good, but what was my surprise when I found out that it's the most despicable rubbish, it's simply disgusting, stupid, poorly written, ridiculous, it's absurd that so many people are enjoying this absolutely outrageous thing. The characters are grotesque, the violence is absurd and disgusting, the story is off-base. It's worrying, people definitely have reduced intelligence, it's not possible, it's hard to believe. I'd like to know what the writers had in their heads when writing this pathetic thing. This is probably the worst series I've ever seen, below mediocrity.",1
Not a show about the fallout universe,"After watching the show in its entirety and the first and second episode one more time for good measure I am certain that the show is not about fallout or its inhabitants.From the beginning, the show ignores one of the core principle of the universe: radioactivity. Radioactivity is the number one thing that the vaults are built to protect its inhabitant against (although vault tech also did some pretty nasty experiments, but this is besides the point), to the point where each and every adult vault dweller is provided with a device that constantly monitor the environment. In this show, it's merely a macguffin.The ending of the show is also a macguffin without resolution: Vault 31-33 remains under VT's control, the BoS gets control of the macguffin, the next macguffin is in NV where the Ghoul and Dog Meat are headed and Lucy tags along because she has nothing better to do.The fallout universe is merely a backdrop, that's why it's paradoxically largely ignored.",1
It's on your own to watch,"First of all, i played the Games and i love the Games. Okay 76 is not the best one,...but anyway... .I tried to give it a chance,...but NOPE.It is not my Kind of Series. It is not that bad like Power of the... but it is not my wishful Idea of Fall Out. Not really Funny, not really violent, not really cool but not even also really Bad. Not really Trash, not really DARK, Not really mine.It could be also a Netflix Series, or the HALO-Serial that is even not so really Bad, but even not really good.So guess i am too old, i stay with the Games and forget about this TRY to make a serial of it.But watch it yourself, it is the best way to find out. I lost completly all of my hopes, to get some good Filmversions from the Games of my Youth.",1
Lazy writing,"Thank you for your request to make the review of a TV show more readable. Here is a revised version that may meet your needs:
Man, I really wanted to enjoy this show. But man is it hard.. One aspect of television shows that I value immensely is when characters are believable and their actions have consequences that impact the plot. In Fallout, however, the characters seem to be playing roles rather than genuine people.The turret scene had me actually in tears. It captured the essence of what plagues the show as a whole. Instead of writing a more believable escape, let's have a minigun miss 120 rounds from only 10 meters away because it looks really cool.",5
Fans of the game will be dissapointed,"The show started off really well very violent good simple story line. The effects where really good all the sets look well thought of. But then after episode 4 everything changes. If your love the game and you expect to see your favourite creatures you love facing in the game in here, well sadly you'll be disappointed. Despite the game being apocalyptic the world never feels empty, there's always danger around every corner. Here in the show our protagonist's are able to walk around the wasteland freely without barely any danger. That's right folks no super mutants, no mirelocks, no mole miners, no deathclaws, barely any ghouls. The shows just literally feels like it ran out of budget midway through. How can you have a fallout show without these creatures? There's no fan service here, as I watching I was like ok we gonna see some super mutants soon? Umm nope never came. What about the walking robots? Umm nope none of that here either. Well screw you johnathan Nolan who claims to love the games well clearly not.",1
So many retcons,"I didn't have much hope for the show, considering Bethesda's track record of retcons. Having the show take place in California raised the stakes even further. Todd Howard claiming the show was going to be canon was practically a death sentence for classic Fallout's lore. Low and behold, the show comes out and all my fears were realized. So many retcons, even of Bethesda's own additions from 3 and 4. Claiming that T60 power armour was used in the liberation of Anchorage, making ghouls dependent on a seemingly magical serum which keeps them from turning feral, changing what time the bombs dropped on the west coast, erasing the most important location Fallout has ever and will ever have lore wise (Shady Sands), reviving the west coast Brotherhood and turning them into a weird pseudo-Enclave military faction akin to what has been seen on the east coast, not to mention the fact that the west coast brother would NEVER fly an American flag, something they are seen doing in the show. The Brotherhood of Steel originating as a fraction of the US military, which seceded from the United States after finding out what was going on in Mariposa. Placing the TV show in California was seemingly a way for Bethesda to finally destroy the last remnants of Black Isles and Obsidian's work from the Fallout franchise. The show displays an obvious disregard for the lore of the universe and location in which it takes place.Furthermore, the show has some arguably ""cringy"" moments. Lucy using the term ""Raider"" to refer to the outsiders infiltrating vault 33; raider being a term developed and used by people living in the wasteland. How does she know to refer to them using this name, when she is shown to be as clueless about the outside world as not being familiar, and even spooked by a tumbleweed upon leaving the vault for the first time. There are also a couple of what I assume to be self inserts by the lead team of Bethesda. Two Vault-Tec employees are named Howard and Emil respectively, who I can only assume to be self inserts of Todd Howard and Emil Pagliarulo. Overall the show feels weirdly disrespectful of established west coast lore, more often than not ignoring it, if not outright retconning established, known facts.",1
I don't get all the good reviews,"The writing is super bad and a a good amount of the actors are pretty bad and take you straight out of belief suspension. I can blame some of that on the dialogue to be honest. But some of the actors were reallllly bad. The young soldier scenes were super cringe haha.The little plots and character motivations were all very cliche and corny.Some of the details, sets and costumes were really fun. But I need some better writing to get into it. I don't know how to find out what's worth watching these days lol.Seems like reviews are completely gamed by those with incentive. Back to word of mouth I guess.",4
Is this only for the gamers???,The show runs slow and no somehow no time go get engaged. Seems like if you don't know the game you can't follow up. It is boring. The logic doesn't a make sense. A real waste of time. And it somehow looks cheap. Like early 2000 tv. Why do they make there shows ? Can't we produce something original with more depth. We keep coming back to poor content for the low denomination. Also the design is soo poor. Nothing make sense. After so may good shows that Amazon produces like the boys. They come out with this as an answer to the last of us. If they aim to the gamers that will get them only the gamers. So please don't watch this don't invest your time and give them more reasons to produce this crap.,1
Horrible Non-Stop Public Domain 1940s Music,"This looks and feels like a parody or comedy, but it is really boring and lame. The non-stop songs from the 1940s makes it painful to listen to.I fast-forward through most of it, since it is one of those shows that fills up time by showing you a character walking every step from one place to another, so you can fast-forward and help them get where they are going faster.Looking at the big eyes and goofy face of Vaultgirl is another downer. There used to be a TV series that featured a mongoloid kid. He could make that look work.A lot of the characters are just dysfunctional and pointless. There is not much going for this show, except the Ghoul, a combination of Clint Eastwood and Rambo.Whenever the annoying 1940s songs start playing, I put it on mute. The dialogue is lame. This show is based on a video game, so dialogue is not a priority. You can guess most of it from just watching. The music is all cheerful songs from the 1940s. I guess it is meant to be a cynical view of the post-Apocalypse. The music is in the public domain, and that is why it is being used (for free). This show is lame for many reasons.",1
great for the first 20 minutes,You wont want to miss the first 20 minutes and then you can turn it off and never give the show another thought. I heard its got 4 story lines going on but i dont want to sit thru most of them to see one. I have never seen a show start out so great with so much potential only to crash and burn as they try to blend in some uninteresting stuff that probably only a die hard gamer could like. Well my opinion is not near as high of this show as most so maybe i should watch a few more episodes but i dont think i can bear it. LIFES TOO SHORT. Gamers probably dont know how short life is yet. I QUIT AFTER MARIO BROTHERS.,1
Not okey dokey.,"First of all I'm not a fan of the franchise but I like the first two games and New Vegas. I couldn't care less about they ruining this franchise further as nothing can ruin the aforementioned Fallout video games for me anyway.The story basically doesn't exist. It's not much different than Fallout 3's story. The whole point of the TV Series is just watching Fallout-themed media and remembering the good old days of playing the video games, not to actually enjoy a TV series to watch. In that regard I would say it's low-quality fan media but I can't because Fallout: Nuka Break and Fallout: Red Star is way better than this TV series for a fan content. So it makes this TV series just a greedy tool to milk a franchise in the worst way possible content.That being said if you are not familiar with the Fallout franchise I don't think things would make sense as there is zero care for a new audience to Fallout. For example I don't think anyone who didn't played the video games can actually understand what's a vault nor what kind of setting this version of world is in this TV series.Despite the aim of making you remember Fallout there was a little from the video games. It's more like they took the fundamentals and they did their own things. There is not even single super mutant but briefly mentioned around end of the season. The only familiar enemy was mutant cockroaches, bear and feral ghouls and that's it. As for weapon only pistol, assault rifle laser rifle was familiar. There is Vault stuff, Nuka Cola and its caps, some foods, Brother of Steel, NCR Ranger outfit, mention of Enclave and that's all about there to see from video games.Basically 2 episodes of content stretched to 8 episodes so yeah every episode is too slow and long. Some of the dialogues are so ridiculous I hope they used an AI because I don't wanna think a person was mentally okay and was good with this. IDK if there will be a 2nd season but sure as hell I ain't watching it. If I wasn't free I would stop at 1st episode instead watching the whole season.Instead of unnecessary nudity it would be great if there was necessary Fallout gore. The gore there is is not enough for a Fallout media. I would wanna see V. A. T. S. targeting at least in one combat but I guess they didn't actually play any of the video games.There are two good things I can say about this tv series. First is very famous actors and actresses plays in it and second is sometimes hearing music from the video games in the right time. Other than these there is no redeeming quality whatsoever.",1
Awful,"Shallow. What can you expect from a series based on a very poor child's video game. NOTHING. Just a whole lot of inane, disjointed rambling.No production value, terrible acting, incompent script. If you desire the best of sifi, try the Apple TV app, then watch Isaac A solo is FOUNDATION, the standard in WiFi excellence.Real sci-fi buffs, avoid FALLOUT at all costs! I was shocked when I saw the imdb high ratings. I just don't find them credible unless penned by eight year olds whose parents aren't interested in raising literate, cultured children. The work is devoid of any educational or moral value, serving as a child's time filler for patents who are neglectful.Can I saw more? Yes, but I'll refrain as you surely get the drift by now!",1
No Dialogue Which Is Annoying,"I regret to say that the new TV show ""Fallout"" was a major disappointment. The first five minutes showed promise, but it quickly went downhill from there.The most glaring issue is the severe lack of dialogue throughout the show, forcing viewers to remain glued to the screen lest they miss a crucial plot point. This makes for a frustrating and tedious viewing experience.The scant dialogue that does exist is poorly written, leading me to believe that the writers simply lack the skill to craft compelling conversations between characters.I found myself utterly bored after just 40 minutes and had to give up on the show entirely. It's a shame, as the premise had potential, but the execution falls flat on its face.I cannot recommend this show to anyone looking for an engaging or entertaining experience. Save yourself the time and skip ""Fallout"" altogether.",2
Averagely bad adaptation show,"Here's my impression after the 2nd episode. They spent so much money on Bethesda rights and Johnny Cash music that they couldn't hire an adequate writer. Bu dum chhhh.It's a hodge podge of uncertain tone and poor character writing. The script and storyline are sloppy.I've played Fallout a bit, and this world is a good aesthetic copy so far. If that's ALL I wanted, I'd just play the game. I'll give that point to them anyways.It had some promise in the first episode. A bit meh, but not all pilots are winners. The characters were introduced, and a story began. Bare minimum set up really.Highlight: Kyle McLaughlin. I love the guy. But I didn't care one bit about his character.The second episode is embarrassing to watch. The music made me cringe and there was no logic in the fight scene. Did you hire Neil Breen as an editor? A yodeler losing their voice on the soundtrack? A literal child as the director?It feels like it wants to be the mandalorian (sp?). But instead of being an appropriately paced adventure, it punches you in the face with lame violence and awkward savagery. And not the good kind of awkward, because it's neither funny nor charming. I didn't laugh once.It's a shame, really. With better writing, this could be really fun! It could be a fish out of water story, with an overly optimistic main protagonist in a harsh world. But it relies too much on aesthetic of the video game without making an interesting story to go along with it.Whatever it's doing, it's shaky. I'd rather watch a show with solid characters and story development.I'll update if I can even keep watching this. But honestly I'd rather just play the video game. I don't have time for sloppy memberberry shows.",4
"If Bethesda says it is canon, it is not","The late Shamus Young made a video essay stating that Bethesda does not understand Fallout. You can find his name on YouTube, but the pertinent quote about BethesdaOut goes like this. Black Isle Studios made games about survivors trying to rebuild from the ashes, Bethesda made a game about the ashes. Shamus said more, but I will stick with my own words going forward. BethesdaOut is basically the creation of two people who are both quite vile in their own ways. Todd Howard's sickening envy and Little Man Syndrome is its own essay, but a quote from Emil Pagliurio or whatever his name is says it all. He tells people at conferences not to bother working on a good story because the player will just tear it up and make paper airplanes out of it.I have been playing Computer RPGs, CRPGs, since before Fallout existed (yeah yeah, trust me, the old man schtick is here for a reason), and I can tell you one thing about them that Emil is pretty incapable of understanding. The story is the whole point of the exercise. The Eye Of The Beholder games of the early 1990s, even the story from the technology-level drop of the ball that was the third game, will be remembered long after Pagliego's name is spoken for the last time. Because although the stories of the three games were rudimentary, they were examples of ""because"" storytelling, as opposed to the ""and then"" that Pagli throws into the games. But a more pertinent example that destroys Paglit's tantrum is Baldur's Gate III. The player character is fighting to stop themselves from being turned into Illithid, a stealing of the soul that illustrates what a disgusting and hate-able race Illithid are. Along the way, we learn that the titular city of Baldur's Gate is under the control of an ""Elder Brain"" or something like that (my memory problems make me unsure if that is the right name) that controls the government and wishes to turn a vast swathe of people into Illithid who do nothing but suck up to it forever and ever amen. This ""Elder Brain"" might be a moustache twirler, but in the context of Illithid and their society being a brutal construct that revolves around slavery and abuse, and they literally know nothing else including the concept of friends or family, is what ""because"" storytelling means.Paglidiot's stories are not constructed with reasoning. He decides what he wants to happen, and then does nothing to make it make sense within the world he is making. In Fallout 4, he tells us that the bad guys in the game wanted a ""pure"" source of DNA to create Human-like constructs to replace people on the surface with. But one, the prologue's shifting of the protagonist from suburbia to the vault would have resulted in every occupant of said vault being stricken with terminal genetic damage. Two, one baby does not come close to equaling a healthy genetic pool. Three, killing almost everyone else in the vault to get this one baby as opposed to calmly leading them away and taking them for study would yield better results. You see what I am talking about yet when I say that Emil Pathetic cannot write a good story? Maybe, Emil, you should make a story that makes the player want to read it? You know, like the makers of Baldur's Gate III (and I and II), Pillars Of Eternity, or the original Mass Effect, did?You might have noticed I have rattled on about the story of the BethesdaOut games a lot. Well, get ready for it. The story in this insipid series is worse. Something I did not think would be possible without bringing Ed Wood back to life and giving him the IP. Slow-burn storytelling works a certain way. As much as I want to keep anything to do with Robert De Niro out of my mouth, the film Heat is a classic example. The big bang inciting incident takes a long time to get to. We spend more than five minutes just getting through the opening credits and meeting the men who will perform the heist. But there is a slow sense of tension creeping in from the start that lets you know something big is coming around the corner. And even with the long, quiet build-up, there is always something happening, something that gives you more information, in every scene.One man at a university course about filmmaking told me, and others, that if a scene does not tell the audience something the audience does not already know about the situation, the characters, or the world, then its proper place is on the cutting room floor. If BethesdaOut The Waste Of Streaming Time followed this rule, it would be a thirty-minute singular episode. And the little pieces of information that it gives maybe three times per hour-long (on average) episodes are communicated so poorly that one could be forgiven for believing that Emil Pathetic gave this project to his eight year old child. We are told that one of our protagonists is getting married to a dweller from another vault, but it takes us another two episodes for the series to properly explain that this vault is part of a three-vault system where dwellers are exchanged.In canon, the vaults are experiments by a very nasty government that has ambitions to ditch Earth and send spaceships across the universe to find another planet and make a better world (yeah, I know how it sounds). Each vault is an experiment to determine what situations could occur and how to remedy them. One rather disturbing experiment that exemplifies the gulf between Emil Poorwriting and Chris Avellone involves vault dwellers being made to elect an overseer every year who is then ritually sacrificed to the vault's computer intelligence, lest every dweller be killed. Year after year, elections have become contests of favours, dirt-throwing, muck-raking, and power plays that eventually erupt in an open war. The end result is five survivors who refuse to participate in any more killing. But rather than the vault killing them, the vault ""rewards"" them by telling them they are free to leave and come back at any time. They choose to commit suicide (and murder the one who has second thoughts about that) because they feel they cannot live with these events. The obvious intent of this experiment is to determine what will happen if an authority figure tells potential passengers ""kill one person of your choosing or we will kill all of you"".In this tepid series, we have a trio of vaults that exchange and wed dwellers... why? What information is a scientist of low moral fibre meant to gain from this? Wait a minute... does Emil Patheticstory even know how scientific experiments work? Does he believe that the company Vault-Tec just do this for giggles? And has he given the slightest thought to how suspension of disbelief works? Then again, given that the authors of this rubbish do not even understand the basic principle of Chekov's Gun, I already know the answer to that question. The words if you fire it in the third act, show it in the first are a bit vague here. In science fiction (which BethesdaOut is not), it is more like ""if you fire it in the third act, explain how it works and why it works that way in the first"". Emil and whoever, you have to explain how it works *before* you show it working. And putting it up on the wall with a sign saying ""junk jet"" is not explaining. Dune parts one and two have killed your kind, Emil. Among other things, they showed without a word, just the actions and visual cues, how the vibration shields that make conventional firearms useless work.We also get a huge flip-off if we are invested in the story of the real Fallout. In canon, the Brotherhood Of Steel is a dying, starving husk because its refusal to adapt and its blind devotion to dogma has drained its life. The New California Republic is in trouble because a good leader has been replaced by an expansionist idiot who clearly never heard the saying ""soldiers win battles, logistics win wars"", but can squash the Brotherhood Of Steel under its boot like an ant. I am not sure whether Chris Avellone and the team used giant ants in New Vegas because Badstoryesda forbade them from using any other assets, Chris Avellone and Tim Cain would probably tell us today that giant ants and giant cockroaches are stupid ideas because the way insects take in oxygen means being over a certain size is impossible (read: fatal) for them.Put simply, Streaming BethesdaOut For People That Shame Humanity fails on every level. It fails in storytelling (I am now recalling that five episodes in, I still cannot name one character that would pass the Plinkett Test). It fails as a science fiction, it is a five year old's idea of what science fiction is. It fails on its own merits, and the list of reasons for that is long. Many of its ""hey, this is supposed to be impressive"" moments would make no sense without having played the game. Many elements make no sense. Probably the worst element is that Buttheadesda wants us to believe that this story is taking place two hundred and nineteen years after the all-consuming nuclear war that the first real Fallout. With efforts to clean up and repopulate Hiroshima and Nagasaki (which are populated today) taking place in 1946. The US Army made pamphlets about Hiroshima that resulted in tourists coming to see the ruins of the ""Atomic city"". The authors of this trash series have no idea that the gap between nuclear destruction of a place and attempts to make the place habitable again is much, much shorter. It is probable that Emil, his minions, and his Napoleon Syndrome overseer have confused nuclear missile detonations with nuclear power plant meltdowns. Then there is the ever-pervasive ""2077 looks exactly like 1957, just with cool toys added!"". A real science fiction author thinks about how technology is pushed by Human nature. Emil and company think a society that can create robots that hover above the ground and can tend to some of the needs of a baby without injuring it would have televisions with screens that are no bigger than a Human head.If you say this series is good, you are not. End of story.",1
"Only watch episodes 1, 3, 7 and 8... Rest of them are just fillers","Fallout series is a cult game series. It's universe is build up upon 6 games. Has lot's of places, characters and stories. However, looks like dear producers and writers of Amazon Studios decided to only use 'the popularity' among these aspects. To make the show suitable for both long-time fans and newcomers, in their own views 'suitable', they mostly wrote it without a decent storytelling. Episodes 2, 4, 5 and 6 suffers from this very badly to be honest. They could have told this story in 4 episodes. Adding 4 more episodes only thin out the story's effectiveness. Other than these problems, it's a faithful adaption and a worthy continue for the Fallout universe. Only including episodes 1, 3, 7, 8.",5
Dumbest show ever,"I hope the game is fun because the show is lame. Characters are fakey and not believable, story is boring and drawn out...I guess someone gets paid by the minute of show made..also some actors are mis cast, bro and sis seem 25 years apart?!? . Why do all the people seem so clueless .. had to really force myself to get through the first episode. Why hype something this much to write a story that makes no sense. I give it one star for the cool robot suits. Another movie that literally uses cgi everywhere and makes it obvious. Maybe try writing a good story first Amazon and then everything else would be ok.dont waste your time , go back and watch the expanse.",1
Fun and promising but let down by bad writing,"I went in with low expectations but was pleased to see it was fun and engaging. I was especially happy to see they didn't make Lucy another Mary Sue.However, now I have watched the whole season I feel it's been let down by bar writing, especially in the area of character motivations, and without going into details that might cause spoilers I would say that the ending will absolutely fiddle with the timeline and canon of the games now - despite what the shows creators said about making an unrelated and original story in the official world.But with all that said I think it's worth a watch if you don't think about it too much - it has the dark humour of the games, the retro-futuristic look (mostly anyway) and it certainly kept me watching all the way through.",5
Everything is spot on but one thing...,"The Power Armour.... The actual design on it looks good, they got the look of it and you can see the dirt and rust built up, general weathering, but when it's in motion and you see the limbs move and the joints interact it feels and looks so cheap. Feet wobble, the body doesn't sit snug, arms look too elongated, and weight..... like how heavy it SHOULD be, is an issue! It sounds heavy, and the sound dept did a good job, but it looks like it weighs nothing. It looks like a cosplay costume made of foam and made to look cool.This worries me because someone, actually a lot of people, at some stage in its production, said ""yes that looks authentic and cool"". It...made...it...far.And that's my issue with this show, everything is perfect, but that godaaaaamn power armour suit. It means Amazon is ok with this. They're ok with that level of garbage. God help Warhammer.",1
A poor mans Elder Scrolls,"The same holds true for tv shows as is does for gaming. A post apocalyptic gun wielding wasteland is uninteresring, even if you throw a billion dollars and hollywood at it. Quality is hard to find and ambition seems to no longer exist in tv shows. As if gaming was a thing for losers. Maybe the actors and viewers are too young to have ever played the fallout games in order to appreciate how infintely better this would have been if these resources went in to creating a show around The elder scrolls Oblivion for example that is probably the best game of all time. The only thing good about fallout is that luck was a stat.Mutated monster people - lame

I had been able waiting for This show,"Sets ✅
Customes ✅
Acting ✅Plot: it was just the game...I assume. I have never played it.It felt exactly like you were playing the game. The overall final goal of the movie was very underplayed and just felt like it was the final quest of the game.I know what you are thinking, it is a game and the game has a storyline. Well if this follows the game's storyline, then it is not a very good game.I expected so much more from the show all while it followed the game plot. There is as just no substance to the show really.The sets, customes, and acting here great. And it ended in what I would assume, to be the ending of the game. Solve the final puzzle, and bam! Game over. Show over. Definitely sets up for a second season.",4
As boring as the gane,"Ignore the game fans! There will be a lot of 10 star reviews from the game fans saying this is all right and the script and scenes are right, that the music and acgion are righr. Ignore them all, thos is a boring show where the action has no continuity, characters do kot develop, actors cannot act. Bad idea was the one to make this adaptation and it has the same effect as the game, they somehow can hype you up to watch/play it just for you to find out later this is boring and storyline is meaningless. It could be awesome but unfortunately it is not the case. If you need something to make noise in the background so you can fall asleep then its good.",1

Horrible stuff,"It's got to be one of the most atrocious TV series, Top 10 at least. I couldn't get past the 3rd episode. Although I'm pretty much aware this is solely based on the games (which I've never liked), the games turn out to be good compared to this demented TV series.How on earth this got 8.7 score??? It's really unbelievable. The only reason must be people from 8 years to 12 years old watching it on a massive scale.The script is horrible, the clichés are horrible, the actors are horrible. There's absolutely nothing to like here if you are 18 years old or older. I'd really like to know how they managed to produce such a giant piece of garbage. Fallout indeed.",1
It's the end of the world and we know it,"Having played most of the games, I went in expecting more ""halo""esque content, virtue signalling to the usual people who won't be watching because too many white people or whatever bonkers things goes through their minds, but slipping easter eggs from the actual game as breadcrumbs so we can all ignore our own amazon vault-tec feeding us our programming.And it does indeed deliver all of that.Whether it's the brotherhood cadet with pronouns everyone seems to respect because tolerance is really one of the building blocks of steel.. :P
Whether it's the shrewd business woman and her lesbian partner in filly who's basically the railroad for wayward enclave scientists.Whether it's the rebranding of communism..It's all there in it's self righteous glory.That said though, the story is about Lucy, who was raised in a vault, with an apparent significant amount of inbreeding that doesn't seem to be touched upon too much, beyond ""messing around with your cousins"". Though it might explain her freakishly large eyes?She has all the subtle hints at S. P. E. C. I. A. L, which suggests she's low S, mid P, lowish E, high C, low I, low A and maxed L. If you know, you know.Her vault 33 is, allegedly, linked to two other vaults 31 and 32, and to combat inbreeding they import breeders from other vaults to carry on the american gene, so one day they can come out of the vaults and reclaim the surface.But alas, this is a ploy of the villain/hero/visionary. Lee Moldaver, played by mediocre actress somethingsomething who cares, she's barely on camera. But she's super scary, everyone says so.. like the 3 times someone talk about her through the entire season..
What we do learn is that Lucy's dad, the overseer of vault 33, KNOWS HER, intimately.. so.. naturally he warns everyone.. oh no wait.. I guess the writers forgot, so he just neglected to tell anyone.. and gets a load of his dwellers killed and himself kidnapped so the plot can happen.Naturally Lucy but also the most useless members of vault 33 survive.. somehow.. and suddenly has an effective security force.. somehow, and doesn't want to rescue her father, so with the help of her kissing cousin and confused looking brother she escapes the vault to go looking for him.From then on it is.. somewhat chaotic where the show goes.Maximus the storm trooper.. sorry brotherhood of steel cadet selling out his comrades the second he is free to, instantly falling for Lucy was uh... necessary for the cringy power armor scenes and needed to be tied together somehow. Also some gratuitous male nudity scenes inbetween. Gotta have those.Cooper Howard AKA The Ghoul, hunting for the mcguffin because he has backstory reasons, really. His story isn't great to be honest, though the actor did what he could with the material. Easily the best character of the show.It scrambles the lore from the games into whatever amazon wants, changing the entire canon from China dropping the bombs because the US was developing supersoldiers, to eeeeevil corporations dropping the bombs to kill the competition.. except it turns out all the vaults are factions competing... so .. uh... factions bad except when good, because that's... that's what the writers wrote.Pitch meeting will have a field day with this..",5
Awful show,"Mixed feelings on this show as far as the main actor. The Ghoul was fantastic, he was perfect for the part, he played it perfectly, make up cool, though his name is just plain, he should have a cool name. The lead female, Lucy, was creepy to look at as her big eyes were made even creepier in this show, adding to the grotesque nature of the subject. Maximus, was just straight up awful in every single way. Watching him made my body hurt, his acting and affect was just wrong, it's like he has special needs or is just not wrapped properly, every time he spoke it was like he knew nothing about life. The CGI in the show in the background was just bad, really bad. Some other parts were done well, but also pretty disgusting and inappropriately gross and could have been left out. The show is all over the place and it's just not for me. I guess you have to be a gamer to appreciate it, but it was terrible. I do not recommend.",2
"Good show, could have been more","Please take into account that 90% of positive reviews haven't played a fallout game before, and it shows.Not even the great cast could can save a storytelling that tries to dillute the interesting stories and setting that has kept me entertained for dozens of years: I mean, you have the whole fallout universe and lore to play about and you chose a lame vault, depict the brotherhood as weak and stupid, and a girl that seems so naive that talks and gives water to a guy with no pants on, on top of that you forget three major, charismatic fations (NCR, enclave and legion), I mean where's the character development, the intrigue, the oh snap moments...The CGI are average and they don't disappoint but they are nothing to write home about either, the action scenes are lame and boring, coming from a player that has nuked the whole wasteland several times with my faithful fatman (portable nuke launcher).I mean, is a decent show, but let me give you an advice: go play the games, there you will find the stories, the drama, the no win situations, the dry humour, etc...",5
What's futuristic about a 1997 video game?,"TL:DR - A good enough opening sequence, followed by no emotions but fear and disgust. Dull, dated and depressing.EXTERIOR, DAY: RICH KIDS' BIRTHDAY PARTYAdapted, as you will know, from a computer game from the 90's., where you roved about killing people, trying to collect weapons to kill more people. That explains why the only emotional content in this lamentable series is paranoia, and it's the oh-so-current (not) nuclear holocaust you've got to worry about, where people live in underground bunkers built by god knows who and powered by god knows what, and any pretence that it might not be a closed studio is abandoned. Graphic, sadistic violence which involves women because you know, feminism, and characters with the depth of Panini stickers.Fine for kids apart from the violence, so it must be aimed at underdeveloped adults. As long as they subscribe to Amazon Prime, who cares?",1
Yikes!,"Amazon Prime's ""Fallout"" series emerges as a vivid tableau of the beloved video game's universe, repackaged with a distinctively modern twist that seems tailored specifically for a Gen Z audience. Helmed by Lisa Joy of ""Westworld"" fame and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, known for her ventures into action-packed science fiction, the series injects a youthful vibrancy into the bleakness of post-apocalyptic survival. However, this injection skews the narrative, favoring contemporary issues and stylistic flourishes that resonate more with new viewers rather than purists of the ""Fallout"" franchise.The result is a series that feels fundamentally disjointed; it's slick and stylized, with an aesthetic and thematic overhaul meant to appeal to younger viewers who appreciate rapid-paced storytelling and visually driven narratives. This focus on style over substance and an evident preference for melodramatic over meaningful character development suggests a misalignment with the original spirit of ""Fallout."" Such a directional shift might capture the fleeting attention of Gen Z viewers, yet it leaves longtime fans of the series alienated, underscoring a generational divide in both the interpretation and appreciation of what makes ""Fallout"" fundamentally compelling. This version of ""Fallout,"" while visually arresting, suggests that sometimes a shared name might be the only thing a adaptation retains from its source material, turning a potentially rich narrative landscape into mere thematic ruins.",1
"Fun, fun, fun!","Very enjoyable show with great production value, setting and premises. Just to put aside this info - I used to play the games back in early 2000s.As a rational analyst however I had some issues with some of the important events which were not build up but relied on luck to happen. Some characters' decisions were irrational and served only to move the plot forward.Also a bit of an issue with the world building. Some characters moved from a forest areas to vast deserts without explaining how is that possible or how much time it cost.Overall - very fun and if some minor issues are fixed via hard work from ""fun"" it can become good.",5
so much BS I can'handle,"I started to watch this series because of all the positive reviews. I like SF and I am able to watch B-movies. But this...OMG You really have to live in another parallel universe to even understand or like this. After 15 minutes of watching the first episode, I just could not handle it anymore. If you are a addict to the game, I can understand maybe, but this setting is not even funny or exciting. BIG skip this one. It starts with redicilous TV's, watches and props I can not place anywhere close to anything I ever watched. Maybe Barbie the movie or something in that area for 13-year olds can compare, but I never watch that stuff as a adult.",1
One star. Disappointing,"A One-Star ReviewIn the realm of post-apocalyptic fiction, ""Fallout"" has long held a revered status, capturing the imaginations of gamers worldwide with its rich storytelling, immersive world-building, and morally complex narratives. So, when news broke of a television adaptation, anticipation ran high. However, the resulting series, while bearing the name ""Fallout,"" is a far cry from the beloved franchise it purports to represent.From the outset, ""Fallout"" fails to grasp the essence of its source material, opting instead for a shallow imitation that squanders its potential at every turn. The show's premise follows a group of survivors navigating the wasteland of a nuclear apocalypse, reminiscent of the game series' setting. However, any semblance of depth or nuance is swiftly abandoned in favor of uninspired clichés and derivative storytelling.One of the most glaring shortcomings of ""Fallout"" is its treatment of characters. Rather than crafting compelling personalities with genuine arcs and motivations, the series relies on tired stereotypes and cardboard cutouts. The protagonist, a rugged survivor with a heart of gold, embodies every tired trope of the genre without adding anything new or interesting. Supporting characters fare no better, serving as little more than plot devices to move the narrative forward without any real depth or development.Furthermore, ""Fallout"" squanders its potential for thought-provoking commentary on the human condition in the face of adversity. Instead of exploring complex themes of morality, survival, and the consequences of our actions, the series opts for cheap thrills and superficial conflict. Any attempts at social commentary feel half-hearted at best, overshadowed by the show's relentless focus on spectacle over substance.Visually, ""Fallout"" is a mixed bag, with inconsistent production values and lackluster special effects. While some scenes manage to evoke the desolate beauty of a world ravaged by nuclear war, others feel cheap and poorly executed, betraying the show's limited budget and lack of creative vision. Moreover, the decision to rely heavily on CGI for its more ambitious sequences only serves to highlight the series' technical shortcomings, resulting in jarring moments of disconnect for the audience.Narratively, ""Fallout"" suffers from pacing issues and a lack of direction, meandering aimlessly from one plot point to the next without ever building meaningful tension or momentum. Subplots are introduced and promptly abandoned, characters disappear without explanation, and the overall story arc feels disjointed and unsatisfying. By the time the season finale rolls around, it's hard to shake the feeling that ""Fallout"" has squandered its potential for a truly engaging narrative in favor of shallow spectacle and empty action.Ultimately, ""Fallout"" is a disappointment on every level, failing to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise it seeks to emulate. From its one-dimensional characters to its lackluster storytelling and subpar production values, the series falls short of even the most modest expectations. Fans of the games will find little to love here, while newcomers will likely be left scratching their heads at the hype surrounding this lackluster adaptation.In conclusion, ""Fallout"" is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved property for the small screen. Lacking in creativity, depth, and originality, the series is a disservice to fans of the franchise and a missed opportunity for meaningful storytelling. With its derivative plot, cardboard characters, and lackluster production values, ""Fallout"" is best avoided by all but the most die-hard enthusiasts of post-apocalyptic fiction. In a crowded landscape of television offerings, this one-star disappointment is best left to fade into obscurity.",1
Did anyone pay attention to the beginning?,"Or pick up on the fact that they were talking about messing around sexually with their cousins? It wasn't even thrown in as a joke, the context was meant to be taken serious. It's already 13 mins in and they've mentioned it twice now and I'm grossed out! Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet wrote this offensive garbage and thought this would be okay to put into show based upon video game franchise and think that kids weren't going to watch this. Heavily swinging towards they need to be locked inside of a prison cell or a padded room away from society. Disgraceful, and I hope to God neither of you have ever put your hands on a child. These two Los Angeles writers ought to be ashamed of themselves and to Amazon who approved it as safe for viewers.",1
Lacking everything,"From the beginning, where they start out in what looks like a 1950's type of birthday party, but is supposed to be in the future??? Anyhow, the story should have ended when the four nuclear bombs exploded. There was no way anyone would have survived it. But somehow it continued, on with poor storytelling, poor acting, and poor effects. A very low budget movie from the looks of it. Then the people that came into the bunker, were so obvious they were not friendly, I will not go into detail. But everything gave them away. And it just continued to go downhill from the beginning of the show. No need to watch the rest of the season, the first show was painful enough as to how a elementary school could put together a movie. This show needed a lot of help, and did not get it.",2
Too funny forpost apocalyptic world,"The gore scenes were tried to be childish, but they are not funny at all. In a certain scene, our character's finger is cut off, but the character does not react at all. Neither funny nor gore. There is a contrived and meaningless humour in series. Fallout doesn't need to be funny or childish. It is also quite pointless to completely delete the story in Fallout New Vegas. How did you find cold fusion? How do the characters live 250 years? While it could have told very nice topics, it turned into a meaningless story and it's a shame. Also, how come 3 characters constantly run into each other in this huge state? Are you too lazy to write logically?",5
LSD fallout,"Should have been a classic show, but full of pointless holes in the storyline. Great cast and acting, well thought out plots and characters, but some things just made no sense, and remain unanswered.How come Lucy had her finger cut off with no pain, and having an old one sown on quickly becoming a normal finger? How come the squire becomes a Ghoul, healing injuries immediately, yet the main ghoul, Cooper Howard, still doesn't have a nose? And many say the bombs were dropped 200 years ago, yet characters who were there on the day either look too young or say it was 20 years ago?Its type of show made for acid users, where you just accept what you see without questioning what is actually happening or happened. Great if you like weird shows, not so great if logic and intellect is your thing.",5
Love / Hate Relationship So Far,"Full Disclosure: I have NOT played the game. I find dystopian-future-based storyline games boring. I'll admit that maybe I'm missing something, but repeatedly killing/maiming zombies/vampires/mutants/gov't agents ad nauseum just doesn't raise my dopamine levels.Having said that, I am 3 episodes into watching this show.I like the story thus far, and I am amazed at the sets (the detail, the size and the ingenuity that has gone into their creation). I find that the character development is also keeping me interested so far. And the dialog, characters, directing and editing are all good, IMO. I really enjoy the ""cameos"" of actors I like that have frequently popped up so far as well.The main 3 things that subtract from the the show to me are these - 1) it's pretty easy for me to figger out what's going to happen next (so far) - yawn...; 2) the lead character/heroine(?), while very well cast, scripted and acted, has something about her personality that makes me want to ram my fist into the screen and smack the 'holy skeet' out of her; and 3) the soundtrack of the 60's Country and Western tunes pushes me to my limits of endurance. Granted, that may be because my Dad constantly listened to this music when I was a kid; but I feel it is mostly because I only like this kind of music when I am really drunk and going thru a some kind of 'betrayal' in my life. It's definitely NOT a music genre I want to hear when I DON'T feel that way!So, to summarize, I am slogging my way thru this show. TBH, I hope it keeps me entertained well enough to put up with its detractions!",5
Expectations will fall,"Fallout: Expectations Will FallAdapting movies and shows from video games seems to be a new trend in Hollywood. This can sometimes be confusing for the audience, if the show does not do a decent job at explaining what is happening, such as in the case of Amazon's new show, Fallout. Jonathan Nolan etal, and executive producer, Todd Howard. It stars Ella Purnell from Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.After the apocalypse destroyed the Earth, 200 years ago. A select number of people got to take shelter in vaults (safe from the outside world). However, when Lucy's dad is taken, she decides to go outside to find him.This show may sound like other shows, such as the 100, but unfortunately Fallout is confusing, pointless at times, and a little bazaar.The first couple of minutes of the show were unnecessary. It explained how the apocalypse happened, but the characters that participated in it had nothing to do with the rest of the story. The timeline jumps to the vault survivors 200 years later. The way the show jumps between two plotlines, (the vault dwellers and people on the ground) is very confusing. The show never makes it clear what the ground people are trying to accomplish. Nothing like how the 100, portrayed the sky people and the grounders. Maybe Fallout should have introduced the ground people, only when the storyline had Lucy (Ella Purnell) needing to know of them. The only way I was able to figure out who some of the characters' names were, was by looking them up. The show does a bad job of introducing other people, besides lucy.For a show labeled as a drama, Fallout has some very strange moments. A dog who eats things that most dogs would not, such as people, a robot that does not seem to serve a purpose in the plot, and very odd creatures that attack people on the ground, for no reason. If the robot were helpful and friendly, like the one from Lost in Space, that would have given Fallout a likable creature.The only two characters that make this show, not completely terrible is lucy and Cooper Howard (Walton Goggins), or as I call him, grave dude, since he rose from the dead. Purnell did a good job at portraying Lucy's caring and innocent nature, in a world where all they seem to do is violently fight. This show may have been a little better if it only focused on the adventure Lucy is having to go on to find her dad. If you are looking for Fallout to be another good apocalyptic siFi show, like the 100, your expectations will fall.",3
Trying my best to stay interested,"Lazy writing, lowsy script, forced dialog. Not sure why ppl are saying 10 stars. It's medium at best. Un realistic drama. The first episode. 3 bounty hunters are after a bounty but first decide to dig up a complete stranger from his grave with the hopes maybe he might help because hes been to california before. And its worth the risk and split the reward with a guy who was pretty much a goner. Let alone bounty hunters trusting a guy they dont even know .So they help him out of hos grave/prison and up getting killed for it anyways. Lol But Ok. So many Other holes in the story I dont feel like getting into. Just lazy writing.... and the knight in armor telling his squire u go check out the pitch black cave by yourself while I stand here and be a complete d*** to you while you do it. Ugh it's so bad. I'm done.",5
I accidentally watched the first and last episode and ruined the whole show for myself.,"I gave this a 2 out of 10 because everything I saw was fantastic. The first episode was incredible and true to source material while being its own story at the same time. And then my experience with the ""2nd"" episode was also very good even tho something seemed off. It was at 41 minutes into the ""2nd"" episode that I checked and realized it was playing episode 8. At this point the whole story was spoiled for me and watching the show was completely pointless. I was incredibly disappointed with this being the case because everything I had viewed was fantastic but also ruined the whole series for me. I'm sure if I was able to see the whole show my rating would be an 8/10 but I have the worst taste left in my mouth left for the show after my experience. Just to feel invested in this season or a possible season 2 I need to sit through hours of spoiled frustration.",2
Characters don't make sense.,"We have a military guy, who knows or did not learned nothing during his time in the army. He is a joke, he doesn't think, strategize, knows about combat or anything, why he wanna wear a power armor?

What used to pass for Hollywood anyway.Oh . One of my faves Mr Matt Berry. Long way from *Darkplace* Maybe not.What are all the grads with Creative Writing Degrees doing, not creating for sure.This is a mess.

Was Disney involved?,"The world of Fallout is a serious place. Life is cheap, and ends with alarming regularity. The first episode was a joy to watch, really enjoyed studying everything in the background. Incredibly faithful to the look and feel of the games, little easter eggs everywhere. Could have done a lot better on Power Armor, but can't have everything I suppose. Watched episode two, and almost shut it off. Fallout is not a slapstick world. I'll watch episode 3, but if it continues down this Disney Kiddie World I'll have to bail. It will pain me to do so, especially since my secret man-crush Walton Goggins brings it, but I can take only so much cornball humor.",5
Average but watchable,"As for scenery, visual effects - well they are simply amazing. (except power armor fly animation, motion there was better in 1980s)

After 3rd episode story becomes very boring, and its starting to focus on moral choices and on not making any sense relation with Lucy and Maximus.Scenes that dont have anything in them last for minutes or are streched beyond reason.Allmost every character in this show is dumb as hell.Scenes of fighting are riddiculus, i dont know if they are dancing or get lost sometimes.Most of things that is happening doesnt make any sense.Survive ability of political correct characters is really annoying.I really enjoyed watching main character - ghul, and tahts it

I could not finish the first episode because of disgusting lines involving incest.,"Yes that's right. Incest script lines at least three times within the first 10 minutes of this show. I could not finish episode 1, and I am considering cancelling my Amazon prime membership because of this. I do not want to support degenerate television and movies with my time or money.I have played all of the Fallout games. I was hoping that this series would show the darkness, grit, and eerie nature of the Fallout world. Instead, the actors are awful, the lines are absolutely cringe worthy. Their attempt at jokes land completely flat. In fact, the only pauses you hear in dialogue is so that that those grinding lines have a chance to land, but they never do. I could not finish the first episode after the 3 or so incest lines within 15 minutes of starting episode one.",1

Must every show have all these intrigue, politics and backstabbing, that we use to only use to get on day time soaps?I am forcing myself to watch this, and unlike A-Team, Stargate or Band of Brothers, will never watch it ever again.",1
suspension of disbelief.,"Thats the only thing you need to know about this series.But since I need another ~600 words here we goSuspension of disbelief is a powerful tool in storytelling, allowing audiences to immerse themselves in fictional worlds and narratives. However, when a TV series relies too heavily on this suspension without regard for logic or consistency, it can detract from the overall quality of the show. While some degree of suspension of disbelief is necessary for any form of entertainment, there are instances where it becomes excessive, leading to a breakdown in immersion and engagement.One of the most glaring issues with a TV series that abuses suspension of disbelief is the lack of internal consistency. When the rules of the fictional world are constantly changing or ignored altogether, it undermines the audience's ability to invest in the story. For example, if characters exhibit superhuman abilities or defy the laws of physics without any explanation or justification, it can feel arbitrary and nonsensical. This inconsistency erodes the credibility of the narrative and makes it difficult for viewers to emotionally connect with the characters and events unfolding on screen.Furthermore, excessive suspension of disbelief can lead to absurd plot developments and contrived scenarios that strain credulity. When characters consistently make illogical decisions or find themselves in implausible situations, it can feel like the writers are prioritizing spectacle over storytelling. For instance, if a character repeatedly survives life-threatening situations through sheer luck or coincidence, it diminishes the stakes and undermines the tension of the narrative. Instead of being invested in the outcome, audiences may find themselves rolling their eyes at the sheer improbability of it all.Moreover, relying too heavily on suspension of disbelief can result in lazy writing and missed opportunities for meaningful storytelling. Rather than exploring complex themes or character development, the focus may shift to increasingly outlandish gimmicks and plot twists designed solely to shock or titillate audiences. This can lead to a shallow viewing experience devoid of substance or emotional resonance. When viewers are constantly asked to overlook glaring inconsistencies or nonsensical plot points, it diminishes their respect for the creative integrity of the show and can ultimately drive them away.Another consequence of excessive suspension of disbelief is the erosion of narrative tension and stakes. When audiences no longer believe in the plausibility of the events unfolding on screen, they are less likely to feel invested in the outcome. Whether it's a life-or-death situation or a high-stakes confrontation, the impact is dulled when viewers are acutely aware of the artificiality of the drama. Without a sense of genuine risk or consequence, the emotional payoff of pivotal moments is significantly diminished, leaving audiences feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.In conclusion, while suspension of disbelief is an essential component of storytelling, it must be employed judiciously to maintain the integrity and credibility of a TV series. When used excessively or without regard for internal consistency, it can undermine the quality of the narrative, diminish audience engagement, and ultimately detract from the overall viewing experience. By prioritizing logic, coherence, and meaningful storytelling, TV series can create immersive and emotionally resonant worlds that captivate audiences and stand the test of time.",2
A good show on its own merits that's hurt by the association to the games.,"On its own merits this is a decent show. We'll developed world, well developed characters, truly excellent production values and good actors. Where it majorly falls down is in being a Fallout show.Transitioning anything from an interactive to a passive medium never really works, but this only has the veneer of the fallout universe. It ignores all the lore, and everything that would make it more ""fallouty"". Ghouls don't sound like ghouls, established lore is ignored or contradicted and nothing is added to justify it.If this was a totally new franchise it would be a solid 8 out of 10. The associations to fallout drag it down significantly, as the tv and the games can't be judged independently. When the TV claims to steer so close to the source material its total disregard for it needs to be factored in.Watch it if you've never played the games, and watch it if you have but just pretend it's not fallout.",5
"Yet again, Amazon ruined a show","Like many shows that Amazon has done in recent years, all our fears about how bad this show might be has come true. They made a show for people that have never played the game. It's not as bad as I was expecting which is why I gave it a higher rating however if you are a big fan of the franchise, you're likely to be as disappointed as we all thought we would be. Oxhorn explained it right in his review of the trailer. It's better than the abomination they created in the wheel of time but not quite as entertaining as the halo series which fans hated. If you've never played thw game then I'm sure you'll enjoy this show since it was made for the non fans yet again, for some weird reason.",4
Lie from beginning,"It was a lie from the very beginning. If the father and daughter really considered a nuclear explosion from such a distance, they would, at least, be blinded forever. Not to mention that all of their exposed bodyparts would have received third- to fourth-degree burns. A ""nuclear mushroom"" in appearance is an explosion of petroleum products. In a real thermonuclear explosion, a fireball is formed, eclipsing the sun with its glow. And it shines like that for several tens of seconds. The day is clear and cloudless. Everything around this holiday would have already caught fire. Plus, the shock wave is much stronger than shown.",1
only played the original game for a couple of hours,"I understand people loved the game, I gave it a couple of hours back in the day and moved on... thinking now I possibly didn't give it enough of a chance. Or maybe I'm just lazy?... I gave this show a couple of hours and didn't mind what I saw. Gave it a couple more and started to enjoy it. A couple hours later (like ep6, 7, and 8) I was hooked and sad there were no more episodes to watch. One of the better shows I've come across in the last few years. Good acting, well written scripts and twists I didn't see coming 2 episodes before they happen. Can't wait for season 2. Although I'm sure that's a long way off. 😟 thinking maybe I'll dust off my PS3 and give it another look?",4
Violent and disgusting,"Disgusting use of extreme graphic violence that does not necessarily serve the plot. Hard to watch, I felt nauseous in the middle of the first episode and stopped watching it.It's like ruining a good restaurant dish with copious amounts of hot pepper and salt, a reasonable person wouldn't be able to enjoy it unless their senses are so dulled by past exposure to a great deal of violent content. In my opinion, it would have been possible to convey the same plot even without injecting quantities of fake blood at the very beginning. If you have a sensitive stomach, save yourself from watching this series.",3
Amazon does it again,"Another attempt by the cash-guzzling giant to completely ruin a series. I bet amazon thought that this would make subscribers forget at how they are getting gouged by the absurd new pricing model. It is a truly awful show. The dialogue is clunky and does not captivate. The action is poorly executed. The entire production is a joke. Honestly, they should fire everyone involved in this abysmal piece of trash. If you enjoy the game series then do not watch this garbage. It is truly a waste of your life to gaze upon such a poorly executed production. If this is what the writer's strike fought for, they need to give up. Because this is not worth a penny.",2
"Great world building, interesting story with some strange plot holes","I have never played the game, so my review is based on the TV show only.The world building and production quality is excellent. The sets, costumes, direction and cinematography are all great. The first few episodes grabbed my attention and held nearly all the way to the end.The problems came in the last couple of episodes. What happened in Vault 32? Don't know. Who cleaned it up? Don't know? Who poisoned the raiders and why? Don't know.Why didn't the self harm boot girl get punished? Don't know. Who gave her authority to decide who can be a knight? Don't know.I hope the attention to detail gets better in season two.",5
Visually faithful to the games but seems to aim for mediocrity,"This isn't the worst adaption ever (far from it), but neither is it amazing as a standalone piece of entertainment.It's just bland. And unimaginative.Terrible fightscenes. Possibly the worst fight scenes I've seen to date. Apparently we have Steve Battaglia to thank for them, who also made the worst John Wick and Expendable movie fight scenes.Characters are okay. Side characters are kinda funny, sometimes.Dialogue is fine, leagues ahead of anything Netflix generally makes (I have no idea why theirs is uniquely bad).Comedic theme works well with the over the top violence and gore.I'm not a huge fan of the Bethesda Fallout games but they managed to water down their already watered down take of the original IP.Not that that is it's worst quality - that is easily the lack of pressing (character) stakes.Only worth your time if you're really bored.",5
